<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>THREE TRAVELERS</h3>
</div>

<p>It was good to rest in the seclusion of my hollow
sycamore. It was pleasant to know that in the
early morning my horse would soon cover the four
miles separating me from the soil of Virginia. As
a surveyor, and now as a messenger between Fort
Pitt and His Lordship, the Earl of Dunmore, our
royal governor, I had utilized this unique shelter
more than once when breaking my journey at the
junction of the Monongahela and the Cheat.</p>
<p>I had come to look upon it with something of affection.
It was one of my wilderness homes. It
was roughly circular and a good eight feet in diameter,
and never yet had I been disturbed while occupying
it.</p>
<p>During the night I heard the diabolic screech of
a loon somewhere down the river, while closer by
rose the pathetic song of the whippoorwill. Strange
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_2' name='page_2'></a>2</span>
contrasts and each very welcome in my ears. I was
awake with the first rays of the sun mottling the
bark and mold before the low entrance to my retreat.
The rippling melody of a mocking-bird deluged
the thicket. Honey-bees hovered and buzzed
about my tree, perhaps investigating it with the idea
of moving in and using it for a storehouse. The
Indians called them the &#8220;white man&#8217;s flies,&#8221; and
believed they heralded the coming of permanent settlements.
I hoped the augury was a true one, but
there were times when I doubted.</p>
<p>Making sure that the priming of my long Deckhard
rifle was dry, I crawled out into the thicket
and stood erect. As far as the eye could roam
stretched the rich bottom-lands and the low ridges,
covered with the primeval growths of giant walnuts,
maples, oaks and hickory. Small wonder that the
heart of the homeseeker should covet such a country.</p>
<p>Groves of beeches, less desired by settlers, were
noisy with satisfied squirrels. From river to ridge
the air was alive with orioles and cardinals and red-starts.
And could I have stood at the western rim
of my vision I would have beheld the panorama repeated,
only even richer and more delectable; for
there was nothing but the ancient forest between me
and the lonely Mississippi.</p>
<p>Birds and song and the soft June air and the mystery
of the Kentucky country tugging at my heartstrings.
I felt the call very strong as I stood there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3' name='page_3'></a>3</span>
in the thicket, and gladly would I have traveled
West to the richest game-region ever visited by
white men. From some who had made the trip I
had heard wonderful stories of Nature&#8217;s prodigality.
There were roads made through tangled thickets by
immense herds of buffaloes smashing their way five
abreast. Deer were too innumerable to estimate.
To perch a turkey merely required that one step a
rod or two from the cabin door. Only the serious
nature of my business, resulting from the very serious
nature of the times, held me back.</p>
<p>On this particular morning when the summer was
in full tide of song and scents and pleasing vistas, I
was bringing important despatches to Governor
Dunmore. The long-looked-for Indian war was
upon us. From the back-country to the seaboard
Virginians knew this year of 1774 was to figure
prominently in our destiny.</p>
<p>In the preceding spring we realized it was only a
question of time when we must &#8220;fort&#8221; ourselves, or
abandon the back-country, thereby losing crops and
cabins. When young James Boone and Henry
Russell were killed by Indians in Powell&#8217;s Valley in
the fall of 1773, all hope of a friendly penetration of
the western country died. Ever since Colonel
Bouquet&#8217;s treaty with the Ohio tribes on the collapse
of Pontiac&#8217;s War the frontier had suffered
from many small raids, but there had been no organized
warfare.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4' name='page_4'></a>4</span></p>
<p>During those ten years much blood had been
spilled and many cabins burned, but the red opposition
had not been sufficient to stop the backwoodsmen
from crowding into the Alleghanies. And only
a general war could prevent them from overflowing
down into the bottoms of the Ohio. The killing of
friendly Shawnees at Pipe Creek below the mouth
of the Little Kanawha in April, followed three
days later by the cruel slaughter of John Logan&#8217;s
relatives and friends at Baker&#8217;s groggery opposite
Yellow Creek, had touched off the powder.</p>
<p>But the notion that the massacre of Logan&#8217;s
people at Joshua Baker&#8217;s house was the cause of the
war is erroneous. For any one living in the country
at the time to have believed it would be too ridiculous.
That brutal affair was only one more brand
added to a fire which had smoldered for ten years.</p>
<p>It happened to be the last piece of violence before
both red and white threw aside make-believe and
settled down to the ghastly struggle for supremacy.
Hunters bound for Kentucky had suffered none
from the Indians except as they had a brush with
small raiding-parties. But when Daniel Boone undertook
to convey his wife and children and the
families of his friends into the wonderland the natives
would have none of it. In killing his son and
young Russell, along with several of their companions,
the Indians were merely serving notice of
no thoroughfare for home-builders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5' name='page_5'></a>5</span></p>
<p>So let us remember that Dunmore&#8217;s War was the
inevitable outcome of two alien races determined on
the same prize, with each primed for a death-struggle
by the memories of fearful wrongs. It is useless
to argue which race gave the first cause for retaliation;
it had been give and take between them for
many years. Nor should our children&#8217;s children,
because of any tendency toward ancestor-worship,
be allowed to believe that the whites were invincible
and slaughtered more natives than they lost of their
own people.</p>
<p>There were white men as merciless and murderous
as any Indians, and some of these had a rare
score of killings to their discredit. Yet in a man-for-man
account the Indians had all the best of it.
Veterans of Braddock&#8217;s War insisted that the frontier
lost fifty whites for each red man killed. Bouquet
and other leaders estimated the ratio in Pontiac&#8217;s
War to have been ten to one in favor of the
Indians.</p>
<p>This reduction proved that the settlers had learned
something from the lessons taught in the old French
War. Our people on the border knew all this and
they were confident that in the struggle now upon
them they would bring the count down to one for
one.<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> So let the youngsters of the new day learn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6' name='page_6'></a>6</span>
the truth; that is, that the backwoodsmen clung to
their homes although suffering most hideously.</p>
<p>Virginia understood she must sustain the full
brunt of the war, inasmuch as she comprised the disputed
frontier. It was upon Virginia that the red
hatred centered. I never blamed the Indians for
this hate for white cabins and cleared forests and
permanent settlements. Nor should our dislike of
the Indians incite sentimental people, ignorant of
the red man&#8217;s ways and lacking sympathy with our
ambitions, to denounce us as being solely responsible
for the brutal aspects such a struggle will always
display.</p>
<p>It should also be remembered that the men of
Pennsylvania were chiefly concerned with trade.
Their profits depended upon the natives remaining
undisturbed in their ancient homes. Like the French
they would keep the red man and his forests unchanged.</p>
<p>Naturally they disapproved of any migrations
over the mountains; and they were very disagreeable
in expressing their dissatisfaction. We retorted,
overwarmly doubtless, by accusing our northern
sister of trading guns and powder to the Indians for
horses stolen from Virginia. There was bad blood
between the two colonies; for history to gloss over
the fact is to perpetrate a lie. Fort Pitt, recently
renamed Fort Dunmore by the commandant, Doctor
John Connolly, controlled the approach to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7' name='page_7'></a>7</span>
Ohio country. It was a strong conditional cause
of the war, peculiar as the statement may sound to
those born long after the troublesome times of 1774.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania accused our royal governor of being
a land-grabber and the catspaw or partner of land-speculators.
His Lordship was interested in land-speculation
and so were many prominent Virginians.
It is also true that claims under Virginia patents
would be worthless if Pennsylvania controlled the
junction of the Monongahela and the Alleghany
Rivers and sustained her claims to the surrounding
country.</p>
<p>It is another fact that it was the rifles of Virginia
which protected that outlying region, and that many
of the settlers in the disputed territory preferred
Virginia control. Every one realized that should
our militia push the Indians back and win a decisive
victory our claims would be immensely strengthened.
And through Doctor Connolly we were already
handling affairs at Fort Pitt.</p>
<p>Because of these and other facts there was an
excellent chance for an intercolonial war. I am of
the strong opinion that an armed clash between the
hotheads of the two provinces would have resulted
if not for the intervention of the Indian war.</p>
<p>At the beginning of hostilities the Indians proclaimed
they would whip Pennsylvania and would
roast Virginians. However, when Benjamin Speare,
his wife and six children were massacred on Dunkard
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8' name='page_8'></a>8</span>
Creek early in June, with similar bloody murders
being perpetrated at Muddy Creek, all on Pennsylvania
soil, by John Logan, the Mingo chief, there
was less foolish talk north of the line.</p>
<p>All these thoughts of raids and reprisals, of white
striving to outdo red in cruelty, may seem to harmonize
but ill with that soft June morning, the flight
of the red-start, the song of the oriole and the impish
chatter of the squirrels. Beech and oak urged one
to rest in the shade; the limpid waters of the river
called for one to strip and bathe.</p>
<p>To heed either invitation incautiously invited the
war-ax to be buried in the head. However, we of
the border always had had the Indian trouble, and
each generation had taken its pleasure with a wary
eye and ready weapons. Although the times were
very dangerous and I was serving as scout for thirty-three
cents a day I could still enjoy the sweet
aromas and sympathize with the song of birds and
yet keep an eye and ear open for that which concerned
my life.</p>
<p>In ascending the Monongahela I had seen many
settlers crossing the river to make the eastern settlements.
I was told that a thousand men, women
and children had crossed during the space of twenty-four
hours. Down on the Clinch and Holston
the settlers were either &#8220;forting&#8221; or fleeing.</p>
<p>Much of this retirement was compelled by the sad
lack of powder and lead, even of guns. More
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9' name='page_9'></a>9</span>
than one settler depended entirely upon ax or scythe
for protection. Such were prevented from using
the advantage of their stout walls and could do the
foe no mischief until after the door had been battered
down, when of course all the advantage shifted
to the side of the invader.</p>
<p>By this I do not mean to disparage such tools as
implements of war. A sturdy fellow with both
hands gripping a scythe can do an amazing amount
of damage at close quarters, as more than one
Shawnee war-party has learned.</p>
<p>Briefly summed up, there were dissensions between
some of the colonies over the land-disputes;
sparks were flying between the colonies and the
mother-country; every day brought gruesome news
from the back-country; there was a scarcity of guns
and ammunition; militia captains were eagerly stealing
one another&#8217;s men to fill their quotas.</p>
<p>Yet regardless of all these troubles let it be understood
that for once the borders welcomed war and
insisted upon it. As early as March, a month before
the Pipe and Yellow Creek outrages, the Williamsburg
<i>Gazette</i> printed an address to Lord Dunmore,
stating that &#8220;an immediate declaration of war
was necessary, nay inevitable.&#8221; Not only did the
whites want the war, but the natives also were eager
for it.</p>
<p>But enough of whys and wherefores, as they make
poor story-telling, and leave me, Basdel Morris,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10' name='page_10'></a>10</span>
overlong in quitting the thicket about my tree. And
yet the wise man always looks backward as well as
forward when entering on a trail, and children yet
unborn may blaze a better trace if they understand
what lies behind them.</p>
<p>I ate my breakfast there in the thick growth, packing
my hungry mouth with parched corn and topping
off with a promise of turkey, once I drew
beyond the danger-belt. Trying to make myself
believe my appetite was satisfied, I began the delicate
task of leaving cover without leaving any
signs. My horse was a fourth of a mile from my
tree, so that in finding him the Indians would not
find me.</p>
<p>The river sang a drowsy song a short distance
from my tree and down a gentle slope. I knew of a
spring beneath its bank, and I was impatient to taste
its cold waters. I moved toward it slowly, determined
that if an Indian ever secured my long black
hair it would not be because he caught me off my
guard. With ears and eyes I scouted the river-bank.</p>
<p>The flights and songs of birds and the boisterous
chatter of the squirrels now became so many helps.
There were no intruders in the grove of beech.
There was no one between me and the river. At
last I passed under some overhanging boughs and
slipped down the bank to the water&#8217;s edge.</p>
<p>Once more I searched both banks of the river, the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11' name='page_11'></a>11</span>
Cheat, and then ventured to drink. Like an animal
I drank a swallow, then threw up my head and
glanced about. It took me some time to drink my
fill, but I was not tomahawked while at the spring.
At last I was convinced I had the bank to myself;
and satisfied that the screen of overhanging boughs
screened me from any canoe turning a bend up- or
down-stream I removed my clothes and very softly
slipped into the water.</p>
<p>There could be no hilarious splashing nor swimming,
but the silent immersion was most refreshing.
It was while supine on my back with only my nose
and toes above water that I received my first alarm
for that morning. My position being recumbent I
was staring up at the sky and in the direction of up-stream,
and I saw a speck.</p>
<p>It was circling and from the west a smaller speck
was hastening eastward. A third tiny speck showed
on the southern skyline. Turkey-buzzards. The
one circling had sighted dead beast or man. The
others had seen the discoverer&#8217;s maneuvers advertising
his good luck; and now each scavenger in
hastening to the feast drew other scavengers after
him.</p>
<p>I crawled ashore and hurriedly began slipping
into my few garments. I drew on my breeches and
paused for a moment to part the shrubbery and stare
into the sky. I was startled to observe the buzzards&mdash;there
were three of them now&mdash;were much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
nearer, as if following something. I pulled on my
leggings and finished fitting my moccasins carefully
about the ankles to keep out all dust and dirt
and took my second look.</p>
<p>The buzzards were five, and in making their wide
circles they had again cut down the distance. Then
it dawned upon me that they were following something
in the river. I watched the bend, the buzzards
ever circling nearer, their numbers continually
being augmented by fresh arrivals. At last it came
in sight&mdash;a canoe containing one man.</p>
<p>Hastily drying my hands on my hunting-shirt, I
picked up my rifle and drew a bead on the distant
figure. The man was an Indian and was allowing
the canoe to drift. But why should the turkey-buzzards
follow him? As I pondered over this problem
and waited to learn whether he be friendly or hostile,
there came the <i>spang</i> of a rifle from my side of the
river and above me.</p>
<p>A second shot quickly followed and I thought the
figure in the canoe lurched to one side a bit. Still
there was no attempt made to use the paddle. The
shrill ear-splitting scream of a panther rang out, and
this like the two shots was on my side of the river.
That the Indian made no move to escape was inexplicable
unless the first shot had killed him outright.</p>
<p>The canoe was deflected toward my hiding-place,
and I expected to hear another brace of shots from
above me. But there was no more shooting, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
the canoe swung in close enough for me to observe
the Indian was holding something between his teeth.
I now recognized him as a friendly native, a Delaware;
and anxious to protect him from those lurking
on the bank I showed myself and softly called:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bald Eagle is in danger! Paddle in here.&#8221;</p>
<p>He paid no attention to my greeting, although the
canoe continued its approach until it grounded
against the bank. I slipped down to the water to
urge him to come ashore and take cover. He was
a well-known chief, and for years very friendly to
the whites. The thing he held in his mouth was a
piece of journey-cake, only he was not eating it as I
had first supposed. As I gained the canoe I noticed
a paddle placed across it so as to support his back,
and another so braced as to prop up his head.</p>
<p>The man was dead. There was a hideous wound
at the back of his head. He had been struck down
with an ax. While I was weighing this gruesome
discovery the scream of the panther rang out again
and close by, and the bushes parted and I wheeled in
time to strike up a double-barrel rifle a young man
was aiming at the chief.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve fired at him twice already, Shelby
Cousin,&#8221; I angrily rebuked. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that about
enough?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothin&#8217; ain&#8217;t &#8217;nough till I git his sculp,&#8221; was the
grim reply; and Cousin, scarcely more than a boy,
endeavored to knock my rifle aside.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
&#8220;At least you ought to kill before you scalp,&#8221; I
said.</p>
<p>His lips parted and his eyes screwed up into a perplexed
frown and he dropped the butt of his rifle to
the ground. Holding the barrels with both hands,
he stared down at the dead man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some one bu&#8217;sted him with a&#8217; ax most vastly,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;An&#8217; me wastin&#8217; two shoots o&#8217; powder
on the skunk!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Without bothering to notice the turkey-buzzards
that have been following him down the river,&#8221; I
said.</p>
<p>He looked sheepish and defended himself:</p>
<p>&#8220;The cover was too thick to see anything overhead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was a friend to the whites. He has been
murdered. His killer struck him down from behind.
As if murder wasn&#8217;t bad enough, his killer tried to
make a joke of it by stuffing journey-cake in his
mouth. The cake alone would tell every red who
sees him that a white man killed him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only trouble with the joke is that there ain&#8217;t a
couple o&#8217; him,&#8221; hissed young Cousin. &#8220;But the fellor
who played this joke owes me two shoots of
powder. I &#8217;low he&#8217;ll pay me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You know who he is?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Seen Lige Runner up along. I &#8217;low it will be
him. Him an&#8217; me look on Injuns just the same
way.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fellows like him and Joshua Baker and Daniel
Greathouse who bring trouble to the settlements,&#8221;
I said.</p>
<p>His face was as hard as a mask of stone as he
looked at me. His eyes, which should have glowed
with the amiable fires of youth, were as implacably
baleful as those of a mad wolf.</p>
<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t go for to figger me in with Baker an&#8217;
Greathouse?&#8221; he fiercely demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know your story. It wouldn&#8217;t be just to rank
you with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe it&#8217;s my story what turns other men ag&#8217;in&#8217;
these critters,&#8221; he coldly suggested. &#8220;There was a
time when I had a daddy. He talked like you do.
He called some o&#8217; the red devils his friends. He believed
in &#8217;em, too. Cornstalk, the Shawnee devil,
was his good friend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Daddy an&#8217; mammy &#8217;lowed we could live on Keeney&#8217;s
Knob till all git-out bu&#8217;sted up an&#8217; never have
no trouble with friendly Injuns. That was ten
years ago. I was eight years old. Then Cornstalk
made his last visit. Daddy had just brought in
some deer meat. Made a feast for th&#8217; bloody devils.</p>
<p>&#8220;I happened to be out in the woods when it was
done. Or, happen like, I&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; gone along t&#8217;others.
There&#8217;s two things that&#8217;ll make me hunt Cornstalk
an&#8217; his Shawnees to the back-country o&#8217; hell&mdash;my
little sister, an&#8217; their overlookin&#8217; to wipe me out.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned and stood by the canoe, glaring down
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
at the dead man. All Virginia was familiar with
the terrible story of the Cousin massacre at Keeney&#8217;s
Knob. Fully as tragic and horrible to me, perhaps,
was the terrible change in the only survivor. He became
an Injun-killer as soon as he was able to handle
a rifle; and a Virginia boy of twelve was ashamed
when he failed to bring down his squirrel shot
through the head.</p>
<p>At eighteen Cousin was hated and feared by the
Ohio tribes. He was not content to wait for Shawnee
and Mingo to cross the river, but made frequent
and extremely hazardous trips into their country.
His panther-scream had rung out more than once
near the Scioto villages to proclaim a kill.</p>
<p>Isaac Crabtree was a killer, but his hate did not
make him rash. Jesse Hughes would have been one
of our best border scouts if not for his insane hatred
of Indians. He killed them whenever he met them;
nor did he, like Crabtree, wait until the advantage
was all on his side before striking. William White,
William Hacker and John Cutright massacred five
inoffensive Indian families at Bulltown on the Little
Kanawha as a reprisal for the Stroud family, slain
on Elk River.</p>
<p>Elijah Runner, who Cousin believed had killed
Bald Eagle, was yet another with an insatiable thirst
for red blood. Many others were notorious Injun-killers.
Some were border ruffians; some were
driven to the limits of hate because of scenes they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
had witnessed or losses they had suffered. But none
was like Shelby Cousin.</p>
<p>Other killers would drink and make merry at
times, keeping their hate in the background until a
victim appeared. Young Cousin carried his hate in
his face as well as in his heart at all times. There
was nothing on earth, so far as I ever learned, no
friendships, no maiden&#8217;s smile, which could divert
him from the one consuming passion of his life.</p>
<p>His mention of his sister revealed the deepest
depth of his anguish. His parents were beyond all
suffering and the need of pity. His sister, a year
older than he, had been carried off. The pursuers
found her clothing by a creek near the ruined cabin;
but it had never been proved that she was dead. It
was this, the uncertainty of her fate, which daily fed
the boy&#8217;s hate and drove him to the forest, where he
sought to learn the truth and never relinquished an
opportunity to take his revenge.</p>
<p>&#8220;If Lige Runner done for him he sure did a good
job,&#8221; Cousin muttered. &#8220;He sure did make tomahawk
improvements on him.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
<p>&#8220;You never kill in or near the settlements as some
of them do,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>His eyes closed and what should have been a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
rarely handsome boyish face, a face to stir the heart
of any maiden to beating faster, was distorted with
the pain he was keeping clamped down behind his
clenched teeth.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only because o&#8217; what I seen at Keeney&#8217;s
Knob,&#8221; he hoarsely whispered. &#8220;When I meet one
of &#8217;em in a settlement I skedaddle afore I lose my
grip. I mustn&#8217;t do anything that&#8217;ll fetch a parcel of
&#8217;em down to carry off some other feller&#8217;s little sister.
If I know&#8217;d she was dead&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d stop killing long enough to question
some of the Shawnees you might learn the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I stopped&mdash;just afore the killin&#8217; at Baker&#8217;s Bottom.
Kept my Injun alive all night. But he
wouldn&#8217;t tell.&#8221;</p>
<p>I shuddered at the cold-bloodedness of him.</p>
<p>&#8220;You tortured him and perhaps he knew nothing
to tell,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If he didn&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; it was hard luck for
him,&#8221; he quietly agreed. &#8220;But I was sartain from
things he had boasted that he was at the Knob that
day. What you goin&#8217; to do with this varmint?&#8221;</p>
<p>And he nodded toward the dead voyager.</p>
<p>&#8220;My business won&#8217;t allow me to take the time
necessary to dig a grave where his friends can&#8217;t find
him or wild animals dig him out. We&#8217;ll set him
afloat again and hope he&#8217;ll journey far down the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
river before his friends find him. He was friendly
to us&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Friendly&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; interrupted the boy. &#8220;So was
Cornstalk friendly!&#8221;</p>
<p>I removed the journey-cake from the grinning
mouth and placed the rigid figure in the bottom of
the canoe. Before I could push the craft into the
current young Cousin grunted with satisfaction and
pointed to two bullet-holes, close together, just back
of the ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;Knew I must hit pretty close to where I was
shootin&#8217;,&#8221; he muttered as he made up the bank.</p>
<p>I shoved the canoe from shore and called after
him: &#8220;If you will wait until I get my horse we
might travel together.&#8221;</p>
<p>He waved his hand in farewell and informed me:
&#8220;I&#8217;ve got some business west o&#8217; here. It&#8217;s out o&#8217;
your path if you&#8217;re makin&#8217; for the Greenbriar.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But a bit of gossip. I&#8217;m just back from Fort
Pitt,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>He halted and leaned on his rifle and stared at
me with lack-luster eyes, and in a monotonous voice
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ed Sharpe, Dick Stanton, Eph Drake an&#8217; Bill
Harrel are scoutin&#8217; the head o&#8217; Powell&#8217;s Valley.
Wanted me to go but the signs wa&#8217;n&#8217;t promisin&#8217;
&#8217;nough. Logan says he&#8217;ll take ten sculps for one.
He still thinks Michael Cresap led the killin&#8217; at
Baker&#8217;s&mdash;an&#8217; Cresap was at Red Stone when it happened.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
Cresap wants to be mighty keerful he don&#8217;t
fall into Logan&#8217;s hands alive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Half the folks on the South Fork o&#8217; the Clinch
can&#8217;t raise five shoots o&#8217; powder. Folks on Rye
Cove been movin&#8217; over to the Holston, leavin&#8217; their
cattle behind. Mebbe I&#8217;ll scout over that way by &#8217;n&#8217;
by.</p>
<p>&#8220;Augusta boys ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to have any man in
their militia company that stands under six feet in
his moccasins. Folks between the heads o&#8217; Bluestone
an&#8217; Clinch so skeered they prob&#8217;ly won&#8217;t stay
to lay by their corn. Injuns signs up Sandy Creek
has made some o&#8217; Moccasin an&#8217; Copper Creek folks
come off. I &#8217;low that&#8217;s &#8217;bout all.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Any signs of the Cherokees coming in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Some says they will. T&#8217;others says they won&#8217;t.
Sort o&#8217; depends on whether they can keep Ike Crabtree
from killin&#8217; of &#8217;em off.&#8221;</p>
<p>He threw his rifle over his shoulder and with a
curt nod turned into the bushes and followed the
bank to find a crossing. He was away on his fearful
business; his youth was hopelessly corroded.</p>
<p>I scouted the spot where I had left my horse and
discovered no signs of Indians. Unspanceling and
mounting, I picked up my journey. I was passing
through a mountainous country which contained
many large meadows. These pleasant openings
would accommodate many cattle if not for the Indian
danger. They were thick with grass and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
enough hay could be cured on them to feed large
herds throughout the winter.</p>
<p>The bottom-lands, although smaller, were very
rich. Along the hillsides I had no doubt but that
grain could easily be grown. Altogether it was a
most pleasing country if lasting peace ever could
come to the border. While I observed the natural
advantages and fancied the glades and bottoms dotted
with happy cabins, I did not forget the dead
Delaware floating down the river, nor ignore the
probability of some of his kin discovering the murder
before sundown and taking the path for
reprisals.</p>
<p>There was no suggestion of war in the warm
sunshine and busy woods-life. Birds rejoiced in
their matings, and the air was most gracious with
the perfume of growing things. The stirring optimism
of spring lingered with me. My heart was
warm to rejoin old friends, to enjoy women&#8217;s company;
but never a moment did I neglect to scrutinize
the trace ahead.</p>
<p>The day passed with no hint of danger. I had
the world to myself when the sun was cradled by
the western ridges. I found it a wonderful world,
and I believed it was never intended that any race
of savages, whites or red, should hold such fair
lands for hunting-preserves only.</p>
<p>That night, according to my custom, I spanceled
my horse at a considerable distance from my camp.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
I had selected a spot on top of a ridge, where the
maples and walnuts grew thick. I perched a turkey
in the gloaming and roasted him over a small fire.
Having eaten, I walked to the edge of the growth
and gazed toward the west. Across the valley a
light suddenly twinkled on the side of a ridge. I
first thought that hunters were camping there; and
as the light increased to a bright blaze I decided
there was a large company of them and that they
had no fear of Indians.</p>
<p>But as I watched the flames grew higher. What
had been a white light became a ruddy light. The
fire spread on both sides. My heart began to pound
and I tilted my head to listen. The distance was too
far for me to hear tell-tale sounds, still I fancied I
could hear the yelling of demons dancing around a
burning cabin.</p>
<p>A dead man floating down the river; a boy seeking
vengeance somewhere near the blazing home,
and a scout for Virginia traveling toward the
Greenbriar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>INDIAN-HATERS</h3>
</div>

<p>I journeyed up the Cheat and left its head
waters and proceeded down the Greenbriar without
observing any signs of the red peril which was
creeping upon the country. A great gray eagle,
poised at the apex of my upturned gaze, appeared to
be absolutely stationary; a little brown flycatcher,
darting across my path, made much commotion.
Red-crested woodpeckers hammered industriously
in dead wood for rations. So long as their tappings
resounded ahead of me I feared no ambush.</p>
<p>Wherever nut-trees stood the squirrels made more
noise than did the House of Burgesses when dissolved
by Governor Dunmore for expressing revolutionary
sentiments. A most gracious country,
and because of its fairness, most fearfully beset.
That which is worthless needs no sentinels. I met
with no humans, white or red; but when within a
few miles of Patrick Davis&#8217; home on Howard
Creek I came upon a spot where three Indians had
eaten their breakfast that very morning.</p>
<p>I knew they must be friendly to the whites as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
they had not attempted to hide their temporary
camp. They had departed in the direction of the
creek, which also was my destination. I planned
resting there over night and then crossing the main
ridge of the Alleghanies during the next day, stopping
the night with the Greenwood family on Dunlap&#8217;s
Creek.</p>
<p>Thence it would be an easy ride to Salem where
I would find Colonel Andrew Lewis, commander
of the county militia. I hoped he would provide a
messenger for forwarding my despatches to Governor
Dunmore in Williamsburg. I had no desire
to visit the seat of government, nor was my disinclination
due to the bustle and confusion of its more
than a thousand inhabitants.</p>
<p>A mile from where the Indians had camped I
came upon two white men. They were at one side
of the trace and curiously busy among some rocks
at the top of a fifty-foot cliff. They were hauling
a rope from a deep crack or crevice in the rocks and
were making hard work of it.</p>
<p>We discovered each other at the same moment,
and they called on me to lend them a hand. Leaving
my horse in the trace, I hastened over the rough
ground to learn what they wanted. As I drew
nearer I recognized them as Jacob Scott and William
Hacker, confirmed &#8220;Injun-haters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How d&#8217;ye do, Morris,&#8221; greeted Hacker. &#8220;Catch
hold here and help haul him up.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who is it?&#8221; I asked, seizing the rope which was
composed of leather belts and spancel-ropes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lige Runner,&#8221; grunted Hacker, digging in his
heels and pulling in the rope hand over hand. Runner,
as I have said, was another implacable foe of
all red men.</p>
<p>&#8220;All together!&#8221; panted Scott.</p>
<p>My contribution of muscle soon brought Runner&#8217;s
head into view. We held the rope taut while
he dragged himself on to the ledge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you git it?&#8221; eagerly demanded Hacker.</p>
<p>The triumphant grin was surety for his success
down the crevice. He rose and tapped a fresh scalp
dangling at his belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got it,&#8221; he grimly replied. &#8220;Had to follow
him most to the bottom where his carcass was
wedged between the rocks. Morning, Morris.
Traveling far? Seen any Injun-signs on the
way?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook my head, preferring they should not
learn about the three Indians making for Howard&#8217;s
Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does all this mean, Runner? Do scalps
grow at the bottom of holes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This one seemed to,&#8221; he answered with a deep
chuckle. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t git a fair crack at him, as he was
running mighty cute. Rifle held fire the nick of a
second too long. I knew he was mortal hit, but he
managed to reach this hole. Then the skunk jumped
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
in a-purpose to make us all this bother to git his
scalp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know. He was a good hundred and fifty
yards away and going like a streak when I plugged
him. It&#8217;s too dark down in the hole to see anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;For all you know he was a friendly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We never see no friendlies,&#8221; Hacker grimly
reminded.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Cept when they&#8217;re dead,&#8221; ironically added
Scott. &#8220;Our eyesight&#8217;s terribly poor when they&#8217;re
alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I call it dirty business. I wouldn&#8217;t have hauled
on the rope if I had known.&#8221;</p>
<p>Runner lowered at me and growled:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re too finicky. A&#8217; Injun is a&#8217; Injun. Sooner
they&#8217;re all dead, the better. I kill &#8217;em quicker&#8217;n
I would a rattlesnake. A rattler gives notice when
he&#8217;s going to strike.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve killed a friendly this work will cause
much suffering among the outlying cabins.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! If we took good corn cakes and honey to
the red devils they&#8217;d kill us every chance they got.
We ain&#8217;t forgitting what happened at Keeney&#8217;s
Knob, at the Clendennin farm on the Greenbriar;
nor the scores of killings up in Tygart&#8217;s Valley, and
in other places. Give &#8217;em the pewter every chance
you can! That&#8217;s my religion.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk, Lige!&#8221; cried Scott. &#8220;Ike Crabtree
would &#8217;a&#8217; liked to been in this fun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll feel cut up when he hears about our luck,&#8221;
said Hacker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crabtree&#8217;s feelings do him credit,&#8221; added Runner.
&#8220;But his natural hankering to raise hair is
stronger&#8217;n his courage when he thinks there&#8217;s
more&#8217;n one Injun to dicker with. Young Shelby
Cousin would be the best one for this business if it
wa&#8217;n&#8217;t for his fool notions about killing near a settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Cousin says you killed old Bald Eagle. I saw
the Delaware floating down the Cheat in his canoe.&#8221;</p>
<p>Runner laughed in huge delight, and cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;The world&#8217;s mighty small after all. Ain&#8217;t it the
truth! So you seen him? Did he have the chunk
of johnny-cake in his meat-trap?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He was friendly to the whites and harmless. It
was a poor piece of work.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason why we didn&#8217;t sculp him was that it
would &#8217;a&#8217; spoiled the joke,&#8221; defended Hacker.
&#8220;With his hair on and the johnny-cake in his mouth,
folks would think he was still alive till they got
real close.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The three of us done that,&#8221; informed Scott, as
though jealous of Runner&#8217;s receiving all the credit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Morris means it was a poor job because the chief
was said to be friendly to white folks,&#8221; explained
Runner, scowling at me.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Morris, you&#8217;d better go up to David&#8217;s and tell
Ike Crabtree that,&#8221; jeered Hacker.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crabtree is there, is he?&#8221; I said, deeply concerned
for the safety of the three Indians.</p>
<p>&#8220;He started for there. He&#8217;ll feel mighty well cut
up when he hears about us and this Injun in the
hole,&#8221; gravely declared Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many cabins on Howard&#8217;s Creek now?&#8221; I
asked; for a cabin could be put up in a few hours
and the population at any point might greatly increase
in the space of twenty-four hours. I had no
desire to quarrel with the three men, and I realized
that there was nothing I could say which would
change their natures, or make them act in a human
manner toward friendly Indians.</p>
<p>Runner was inclined to harbor resentment and
refused to answer me. Hacker, however, readily
informed me:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was five when I come through there last.
With outlying settlers pouring in, there may be a
dozen by this time. All I know is that the call&#8217;s
gone out for fifteen or twenty miles, asking every
one to come in to the big log-rolling.</p>
<p>&#8220;Davis and t&#8217;others swear they won&#8217;t come off the
creek till they&#8217;ve harvested their corn. So they&#8217;re
going to have a rolling and build a fort and stick it
out. We fellers reckon we&#8217;ll go up there and have
a hand in the fun-making.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Up near the Pennsylvania line and west of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
Cheat a cabin was burned a few nights ago,&#8221; I said,
hoping they might feel disposed to scout north in
search of Indians who were not friendly.</p>
<p>If the trio should go to Howard&#8217;s Creek and happen
upon the three Indians I feared that nothing
could prevent another ghastly affair. Possibly
Crabtree already had struck, but I hoped not. The
men were interested in my news and listened closely.
I continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a cabin. I know that, although I was too
far away to investigate. I have a notion that young
Cousin was somewhere near it when it burned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you can bet the young cuss gave his panther-screech
and made his kill,&#8221; exclaimed Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you men want to do the settlers on Howard&#8217;s
Creek a good turn you might scout up there and
look for signs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low the signs wouldn&#8217;t be very fresh now,&#8221;
said Runner. &#8220;Show me a fresh footing and I&#8217;m
keen to follow it. But just looking round after the
skunks move on ain&#8217;t my notion of a good time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low Lige is right,&#8221; decided Hacker. &#8220;If the
reds was there a few nights ago they may be down
this way by this time. Either that or they&#8217;ve
sneaked back across the Ohio. I &#8217;low there&#8217;ll be
more up to the creek.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my notion,&#8221; chimed in Scott. &#8220;Show us
fresh signs and we&#8217;re like good dogs on the scent.
We&#8217;d better go to the rollin&#8217;.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s many Indians who need killing badly,&#8221;
I said. &#8220;But if you men persist in killing friendly
Indians we&#8217;ll have the Delawares joining in with
the Shawnees and Mingos.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t hanker for any more Moravian missionary
talk,&#8221; coldly warned Runner. &#8220;As for the
Delawares dipping into the dish, let &#8217;em come. Let
&#8217;em all come together! The sooner we smoke their
bacon, the sooner the Holston and Clinch and Tygart&#8217;s
Valley will be safe for our women and children.
As for that old cuss of a Bald Eagle, we&#8217;re
right glad you seen him. It shows others will see
him. That&#8217;s the sort of a notice we&#8217;re serving on
every redskin in Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was obvious they would not relinquish their
plan of visiting Howard&#8217;s Creek, and it was equally
plain they preferred to travel without my company.
So I returned to the trace and mounted and rode on.</p>
<p>As I neared the creek I came upon several settlers
hurrying in from their isolated cabins, and I
was pleased to see they had taken time to collect
their few cattle and bring them along. Of the
five men I talked with there were only two who had
guns. The others were armed with axes and big
clubs of oak.</p>
<p>One lean fellow carried a long sapling to the end
of which he had made fast a long butcher-knife.
One of the gunmen said to me that he hoped there
would be &#8220;a lively chunk of a fight&#8221; although he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
and his friend had only one charge of powder apiece.
These two were young men, and like many of their
generation they imitated the Indian to the extent
of wearing thigh-leggings and breech-clouts.</p>
<p>The ends of the latter were passed through the
belt in front and behind, and were allowed to hang
down in flaps. These flaps were decorated with
crude beadwork. Around their heads they wore red
kerchiefs. Two of the older men had wives. These
women would impress a resident of the seacoast as
being stolid of face.</p>
<p>In reality the continuous apprehension of an Indian
raid had frozen their features into a wooden
expression. Their eyes were alive enough. I
counted ten children, six of whom were girls. I do
not think one of the youngsters was more than
twelve years old.</p>
<p>The boys were continually bemoaning their lack
of guns. The girls seemed happy over the adventure
and prattled a stream about the new people
they would see at the creek. I think every one of
them had brought along a doll made from rags,
corn-cobs or wood. The maternal was very strong
in their stout little hearts.</p>
<p>One flaxen-haired miss consented to ride before
me after my solemnly assuring her that horseback
travel would not make her dollie sick. She shyly
confessed her great joy in attending &#8220;rollin&#8217;s.&#8221; Her
folks, she said, had not been invited to the last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
&#8220;rollin&#8217;,&#8221; although they lived within fifteen miles of
it; and her daddy and mammy had been greatly
incensed.</p>
<p>But this, fortunately, was a bee where no one
waited to be invited, each settler, living far or near,
having an equal equity in the work. Long before
we reached the scene of activities we heard the loud
voices of the men, the hilarious cries of young folks
and the barking of several dogs. My little companion
twisted nervously, her blue eyes wide with
excitement. Then she was sliding from the horse
and with her doll clutched to her side, was scampering
ahead with the others.</p>
<p>Then we grown-ups reached the edge of the
clearing. Hacker had reported five cabins. Now
there were seven, and if the people continued to arrive
there must soon be twice that number. At the
first of it the overflow would take up quarters
among those already housed, or in the fort when it
was finished.</p>
<p>Ordinarily a settler girdled his trees and chopped
them down when they were dead, and then burned
them into long logs. Not until the trees were down
and burned into suitable lengths were invitations to
the rolling sent out. As this was an emergency rolling
the usual custom could not be followed.</p>
<p>Some of the dead trees were being burned into
sections with small fires built on top and pressed
against the wood by butt-ends of logs we called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
nigger-heads. Boys and girls were feeding small
fuel to these fires. Charred logs left over from
former rollings were being yanked out and built into
the walls of the fort. As not enough seasoned timber
was available for such a large structure green
logs were being utilized.</p>
<p>The settlers behind me handed their two guns,
clubs and other belongings over to the small boys,
and with a nod and a word of greeting joined the
workers. The women and girls looked after the
cattle. Those of the women who were not working
among the logs were busy in the cabins cooking large
quantities of food, for we ate marvelously in those
old days.</p>
<p>As in peaceful times, when a happy home was to
evolve from the &#8220;rollin&#8217;,&#8221; the usual pot-pie, composed
of boiled grouse, pigeon and venison, and always
with dumplings, was the principal dish of the
feasting. On a stump, accessible to all who needed
it, rested a squat jug containing rum.</p>
<p>I turned my horse loose near the fort and sought
out Davis. He was inside the fort, superintending
the work. The walls of this were well up. As the
first need was shelter, and as the Indians might
strike at any moment, no time was lost with a puncheon
floor. The earth must do until the men could
have a breathing-spell. Four tight walls and a stout
roof was the best they could hope for.</p>
<p>Davis paused long enough to inform me that if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
time permitted they would build the fort two stories
high and stockade it with twelve-foot posts. From
his worried expression and obvious anxiety to get
back to his work I did not believe he had any hope
of building more than a one-story shell.</p>
<p>When the Indians struck they would strike with
a rush. They would plan on a quick assault taking
the settlers by surprise. They dared not remain to
conduct a prolonged siege. The fort when completed
would not be any stronger than the average
cabin; it would simply accommodate more defenders.</p>
<p>The nearest water was a spring some twenty
yards from the fort. This failure to provide for a
water-supply was an amazing characteristic of
many frontier defenses. There was no reason why
the fort should not have been built close by the
spring, or even over it. I said as much to Davis,
but he defended:</p>
<p>&#8220;It would place us too near the woods. Their
fire-arrows could fall on us too easy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I reminded him that as the fort was now they
would have but little water to extinguish a fire,
whereas the spring would have afforded an inexhaustible
supply. However, it was too late to change
their plans and I volunteered to collect kettles and
tubs and organize a water-squad so there might be
plenty of water in the fort each night.</p>
<p>&#8220;Might be a good plan,&#8221; agreed Davis. &#8220;But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
&#8217;low if the Injuns come it&#8217;ll be all over, one way or
t&#8217;other, afore we have time to git thirsty.&#8221;</p>
<p>I briefly explained to Davis my business as
despatch-bearer, so he might understand my reason
for departing in the morning. He was generous
enough to insist that I ran a greater risk in crossing
the mountains alone than I would encounter by remaining
at the creek.</p>
<p>I left him and levied on kettles to be delivered
after supper and then returned to the fort. I had
barely arrived when the dogs began barking and
several horses came running through the stumps
from the north end of the clearing. Before the
alarm could find expression in shouts and a semblance
of defense a deep voice called from the
woods:</p>
<p>&#8220;White men! Friends! Hacker, Scott and
Runner.&#8221;</p>
<p>A rousing cheer greeted these newcomers, and
one enthusiast grabbed up the jug and ran to meet
them. Each of the three drank deeply and were rewarded
with more cheers. If they were murderous
in their hatred they would be stout defenders. As
for their attitude toward all Indians, there were but
few along the border who did not have some cause
for hating the natives.</p>
<p>This sentiment of the frontier was shown when
Henry Judah, arrested for killing some friendly Indians
on the South Branch, was rescued by two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
hundred pioneers. After his irons were knocked
off the settlers warned the authorities it would not
be well to place him in custody a second time. Nor
was Judah the only man thus snatched from the
law.</p>
<p>Men like Hacker and his companions would do
very little manual labor. They did not build homes,
but were always roaming about the country. This
trait was of value to men of the Davis type,
inasmuch as the killers brought in much game when
the home-makers were busy with their cabins or
planting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any news, Lige?&#8221; bawled Davis, his deep voice
booming across the clearing and overriding the
clamorous welcome of his neighbors.</p>
<p>&#8220;Found some footing and hoss-tracks,&#8221; Runner
yelled back.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be coming this way, the yaller dogs, and
we&#8217;re here to rub &#8217;em up a bit!&#8221; boasted Scott.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jesse Hughes oughter be here,&#8221; said one of the
men who was notching the long logs.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be along if there&#8217;s promise of a fight,&#8221; assured
Hacker. &#8220;Young Cousin and Ike Crabtree,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low them red devils would skin back to the
Ohio like a burned cat if they know&#8217;d you boys was
after &#8217;em!&#8221; cried Widow McCabe, who was as
strong as the average man and could swing an ax
with the best of them. Her husband was killed on
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
the Kanawha the year before, and her hatred of
Indians was as intense as that of any killer.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll sure know they&#8217;ve met with some trouble,
Missus,&#8221; modestly admitted Hacker.</p>
<p>The three men seated themselves on a knoll and
watched the busy scene. I joined them and inquired
about the footing they had observed. Scott
informed me they had followed the trail toward the
creek and then lost it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a small party of scouts, mebbe not more&#8217;n
three,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We sort o&#8217; reckon that they
&#8217;lowed they might be followed and so took to water.
We &#8217;lowed it was best to hustle along here and git
in front of the fighting, instead o&#8217; losing time trying
to find where they quit the creek. You&#8217;re sticking
along, we &#8217;low.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No need with all you men. I must carry my
despatches over the mountains to-morrow.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better think twice afore trying it alone. By to-morrow
the mountain trace will probably be shut in
by the reds,&#8221; declared Hacker ominously.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must take my chances of breaking across
country. His Lordship must have the despatches at
the earliest possible minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; Runner agreed. &#8220;Wish you luck
even if you got a Quaker stomick when it comes to
killing the vermin. But if you want to git across
you&#8217;d better start at once. Them two or three
scouts shows the devils are closing in. Every hour
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
saved now means a dozen more chances for your
hair to grow.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I believed the footing the fellows found was
left by the three Indians I had pronounced to be
friendly, I was not much exercised in my mind by
the warning. I did not believe the Indians would
seek to cut off the settlement. They must strike
and be off, and they would prefer to have the settlers
in flight over the mountains, with the inevitable
stragglers easily cut off, than to have them
stubbornly remaining in the cabins and fort.</p>
<p>If time was not vital, and providing the Shawnees
could bring a large force, then an encircling movement
would be their game. But Cornstalk and
Logan would not lead a big force into any of the
valleys. They knew as well as the whites that the
war was to be won by one decisive battle.</p>
<p>These isolated raids up and down the western
valleys were simply of value in that they might unnerve
the settlers and keep them from leaving their
cabins to join the army Dunmore proposed to send
against the Shawnee towns. And last of all I was
fagged by my long ride and would have one night&#8217;s
unworried sleep, let the risk be ever so great.</p>
<p>The dinner, much belated, was now ready, and the
workers were asked to assemble in and around the
Davis cabin. Four men were left to do sentinel
duty, and the children were told to keep on with
their work and play as they would be served after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
the men had eaten. Huge pot-pies were hurried
from all the cabins to where the backwoodsmen
were waiting to prove their appetites.</p>
<p>Several jugs of rum garnished the feast. The
Widow McCabe contributed a scanty stock of tea,
but the men would have none of it on the grounds
that it did not &#8220;stick to the ribs.&#8221;</p>
<p>My helping of pie was served on a huge china
plate that had been packed over the mountains with
much trouble and when every inch of room was
needed for the bare necessities. Thus tenacious
were the women in coming to this raw country to
preserve their womanliness. I might have thought
I was being favored had not Mrs. Davis frankly informed
me that her few pieces of china were
shunned by her men-folks on the plea the ware
&#8220;dulled their sculping-knives.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finishing my meal, I seated myself on a stump
and proceeded to remove my moccasins and mend
them. Davis joined me in a similar task; for while
it required only two or three hours to make a pair
of moccasins it was necessary to mend them almost
daily. Davis greatly admired the awl I bought
over the mountains, although it was no more serviceable
than the one he had made from the back
spring of a clasp-knife.</p>
<p>A settler might be unfortunate enough not to possess
a gun, but there was none who did not carry a
moccasin-awl attached to the strap of his shot-pouch,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
a roll of buckskin for patches and some deerskin
thongs, or whangs, for sewing. While we sat
there barefooted and worked we discussed the pending
big battle. He held what I considered to be a
narrow view of the situation. He was for having
every valley act on the defensive until the Indians
were convinced they were wasting warriors in attempting
to drive the settlers back over the mountains.</p>
<p>While we argued back and forth those children
having finished their dinner took to playing at
&#8220;Injun.&#8221; The boys hid in ambush and the little
girls endeavored to steal by them without being
&#8220;sculped.&#8221; Along the edge of the clearing were
five or six sentinels. They were keeping only a perfunctory
watch, their eyes and ears giving more
heed to the laughter and banter than to the silent
woods. At the northern end of the clearing some
lovesick swain surrendered to sentiment and in a
whimsical nasal voice began singing:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Come all ye young people, for I&#8217;m going for to sing</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>Consarnin&#8217; Molly Pringle and her lov-yer, Reuben King.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>The thin penetrating shriek of a child somewhere
in the forest pricked our ears, the clear falsetto of
its fright silencing the singer and leaving his mouth
agape. I began drawing on my moccasins, but before
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
I could finish a wonderful transformation had
taken place in the clearing. As if the cry had been
a prearranged signal, six of the young men filed
silently into the woods, moving one behind the other,
their hunting-shirts now inside their belts leaving
their thighs bare, as if they had been so many
Shawnees.</p>
<p>They moved swiftly and silently with no more
show of confusion or emotion than if they had been
setting out on routine scout-duty. The child
screamed again, but not before feasters and workers
had become fighting-units. Those possessing
guns ran quietly in scattering groups toward the
forest, leaving the women to guard the clearing and
children.</p>
<p>And the women! They were marvelous in their
spirit. With scarcely a word they caught up the
axes dropped by the men and formed a long line
with the children behind them. Little girls became
little mothers and hurried still smaller tots to the
unfinished fort.</p>
<p>The woodsmen advanced to the woods, the women
slowly fell back, herding the youngsters behind
them. As I ran my best to make up for the time
lost over my moccasins I passed the Widow McCabe.
I shall never forget the ferocious gleam of
her slate-gray eyes, nor the superb courage of the
thin lips compressed in a straight line.</p>
<p>She moved with the grace of a forest cat, reluctant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
to fall back, her muscular arm swinging the
heavy ax as if it were a toy. Abreast of her, and
likewise refusing to retreat, was Moulton&#8217;s wife,
mother of three. She was a thin, frail-appearing
little woman with prominent blue eyes, and her gaze
was glassy as she stared at the woods, and her lips
were drawn back in a snarl.</p>
<p>&#8220;Moulton gal missin&#8217;,&#8221; ran down the line. &#8220;Git
t&#8217;other younkers back.&#8221;</p>
<p>The line began bending at the ends to form a half-circle.
The distracted little mother left her place in
it. Without a word to betray the anguish tearing at
her heart she gathered her linsey petticoat snugly
about her, and grasping an ax, ran swiftly toward
the direction of the screaming. The Widow McCabe
hesitated, glanced over her shoulder. Satisfied
the other women had the children well grouped and
close to the fort, she darted after Mrs. Moulton.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep back, you women!&#8221; yelled Elijah Runner.
&#8220;Stay with the children! They&#8217;re letting the child
scream to fetch us into a&#8217; ambush!&#8221;</p>
<p>This was excellent advice, but the widow and
Mrs. Moulton gave it no heed. One was impelled
by hate, the other by love; and as they crashed into
the growth behind me each was worth a woodsman
or two in hand-to-hand fighting. With unnerving
abruptness a man laughed boisterously directly
ahead of me. Yells and questions filled the arches
of the deep wood.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Everybody back! False alarm! Nothin&#8217; but
the gal gittin&#8217; skeered,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;I&#8217;m fetchin&#8217;
her in, an&#8217; th&#8217; feller what skeered her.&#8221;</p>
<p>Explosive laughter from the men and much crude
banter marked our relief. Mrs. Moulton dropped
her ax and with both hands held to her face stumbled
into the clearing. The Widow McCabe walked
with her head bowed, the ax held limply. Although
rejoicing over the child&#8217;s safety, I suspected she regretted
not having had a chance to use her ax.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here they come! Two babies!&#8221; some one
shouted.</p>
<p>Mrs. Moulton turned and ran toward the woods
again, much as a hen-partridge scurries to its young.</p>
<p>The bush-growth swayed and parted. First came
the frightened child, and she redoubled her weeping
on finding herself in her mother&#8217;s arms. Behind
the child came a grinning woodsman and back of
him rode a tall man of very powerful build, but with
a face so fat as to appear round and wearing an
expression of stupidity.</p>
<p>It was my first glimpse of him, but I recognized
him instantly from the many descriptions border
men had given of him. He was known as &#8220;Baby&#8221;
Kirst, and he was a Nemesis the Indians had raised
against themselves, a piece of terrible machinery
which their superstitions would not permit them to
kill.</p>
<p>His intelligence was that of a child of seven.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
When about that age his people were massacred on
the Greenbriar and he had been left for dead with
a portion of his scalp ripped off and a ghastly
wound in his head. By some miracle he had survived,
but with his mental growth checked. Physically
he had developed muscle and bone until he was
a giant in strength.</p>
<p>The red men believed him to be under the protection
of the Great Spirit, and when they heard
him wandering through the woods, sometimes
weeping like a peevish child because some little plan
had gone awry, more often laughing uproariously
at that which would tickle the fancy of a seven-year-old,
they made mad haste to get out of his path.</p>
<p>His instinct to kill was aroused against Indians
only. Perhaps it was induced by a vague memory
of dark-skinned men having hurt him at some time.
Nor was he always possessed by this ungovernable
rage. Sometimes he would spend a day in an Indian
camp, but woe to the warrior who even inadvertently
crossed his whims.</p>
<p>He was not skilled in woodcraft beyond the cunning
necessary for surprising easy game such as
turkeys, squirrels and rabbits. Regardless of his
enormous appetite food was gladly given him at
every cabin; for wherever he sought shelter, that
place was safe from any Indian attack.</p>
<p>While Mrs. Moulton hurried her child to the fort
and hushed its weeping with pot-pie the young men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
raised a yelping chorus and came dancing into the
clearing with all the prancing steps of the red men.
Deep-voiced oaths and thunderous welcomes were
showered upon Baby Kirst as he proudly rode among
them, his huge face further distended by a broad
grin.</p>
<p>Awkwardly dismounting from his rawbone horse,
he stared around the circle and with one hand held
behind him tantalizingly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Got something. Sha&#8217;n&#8217;t let you peek at it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see it, Baby,&#8221; coaxed Runner, his tone
such as he might use in pleading with a child.</p>
<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; And Baby shook his head stubbornly and
grinned mischievously.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8217;Lasses on mush. Heaps of it, Baby,&#8221; bribed
Davis.</p>
<p>Baby became interested. Davis repeated his offer.
Slowly Baby drew from behind him the scalp of a
white man. It was long, dark brown hair, burned
to a yellowish white at the ends by the sun.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Ben Kirby&#8217;s hair!&#8221; gasped Scott, staring
in horror at the exhibit. Then aside, &#8220;Good God,
he ain&#8217;t took to killing whites, has he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;d you git it, Baby?&#8221; coaxed Hacker.
&#8220;Davis will give you a big bowl of mush and
&#8217;lasses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man had it,&#8221; proudly informed Baby, and
he fished from the bosom of his hunting-shirt a
hank of coarse black hair.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A Shawnee sculp or I&#8217;m a flying-squirrel!&#8221;
yelled Runner. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you understand it, men?
Some dog of a Shawnee rubbed out Kirby. His
hair&#8217;s been off his head these six weeks. No wonder
he ain&#8217;t come in to help you folks to fort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby meets this Shawnee and gives him his
needings. The red devil&#8217;s sculp ain&#8217;t more&#8217;n three
days old. Good for you, Baby! Good boy! Give
him all the &#8217;lasses he can hold. Needn&#8217;t worry
about any raid s&#8217;long as he stays here, Davis. You
can just take your time in finishing that fort.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we could only keep him!&#8221; sighed Davis.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t,&#8221; spoke up a young man. &#8220;Every
one has tried. A day or two, yes. Then he must
go back to the woods. When the Injuns failed to
finish him off they did a bad job for themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll keep him long&#8217;s we can,&#8221; said Davis.
&#8220;Hi, mother! Fill the mixing-bowl with mush and
cover it with sweeting.&#8221;</p>
<p>As proud as a boy being praised by his elders,
Baby started to strut to the Davis cabin, but quickly
fell into a limping walk and whimpered a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Crippled on account of rheumatiz,&#8221; sighed Runner.
&#8220;Rheumatiz has put more hunters and fighters
out of business than the Ohio Injuns ever did.
And poor Baby can&#8217;t remember to always sleep with
his feet to the fire. If we could git him a stout pair
of shoes to wear in place of them spongy moccasins
it would pay us.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></p>
<p>Kirst was too grotesque to laugh at, and the settlers
were grotesque when they smiled at his ferocious
appetite, and in the next moment tried to
buy the protection of his presence. Let him regularly
patrol a dozen miles of frontier each day, and
I would guarantee no Indian would knowingly
cross his path.</p>
<p>More than one party of red raiders had unwittingly
followed his trail, only to turn in flight as if
the devil was nipping after them once they glimpsed
his bulky figure, heard his whimpering or his loud
laughter. The men followed him to the Davis
Cabin, each eager to contribute to the general gossip
concerning the child-man&#8217;s prodigious strength.</p>
<p>As my horse was straying toward the west side
of the clearing I went to fetch him back and spancel
him near the fort. I had secured him and was
about to ride him back when a rifle cracked close at
hand in the woods, and I heard a voice passionately
jeering:</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low that cotched ye where ye lived, didn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>I drove my horse through the bushes and came
upon a sickening scene. An Indian man and a
squaw were seated on a horse. On the ground was
another Indian. A glance told me he was dead
from the small blue hole through the forehead. The
man and woman on the horse remained as motionless
as if paralyzed.</p>
<p>Isaac Crabtree stood reloading his long rifle, his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
sallow face twisted in a smile of vicious joy. As he
rammed home the charge I crowded my horse
against him and sent him sprawling. Turning to
the Indians I cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ride away! Ride quick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are friendly Cherokees!&#8221; cried the woman
in that tongue. &#8220;That man there is called Cherokee
Billy by white men.&#8221; And she pointed to the dead
man.</p>
<p>With that she swerved the horse about, kicked
her feet into his ribs and dashed away, the man
clinging on behind her, his dark features devoid of
expression. An oath brought my head about.
Crabtree was on his feet, his hand drawing his ax,
his face livid with rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse you!&#8221; he stuttered. &#8220;Ye sp&#8217;iled my baggin&#8217;
the three of &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve bagged Cherokee Billy, the brother of
Oconostota, the great chief of the Cherokees,&#8221; I
wrathfully retorted. &#8220;It would have been well for
the frontier if I could have arrived in time to bag
you before you did it. The Cherokees have kept
out of the war, but it&#8217;ll be a wonder if they don&#8217;t
swarm up this creek when they hear of this murder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em come!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;That&#8217;s what we
want. It&#8217;ll take more&#8217;n you, Basdel Morris, to keep
my paws clear of the critters once I git a bead on
one of &#8217;em. Git out of my way so&#8217;s I can git my
rifle. I&#8217;ll have the three of &#8217;em yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you make a move to follow them I&#8217;ll shoot
you,&#8221; I promised.</p>
<p>By this time men were crashing through the
bushes. Then came a louder noise and Baby Kirst,
mounted on his big horse, his broad face bedaubed
with molasses, burst on the scene. A dozen settlers
crowded into the spot behind him. Hacker and
Runner were the first to see the dead Indian.
With a whoop they drew their knives and rushed in
to get the scalp. I drove them back with my horse
and loudly informed them:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s Cherokee Billy, brother of Oconostota, who
can send the whole Cherokee nation against you,
or hold it back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care what Injun it is,&#8221; howled Hacker.
&#8220;Hair&#8217;s hair. Git out the way, or you&#8217;ll git acquainted
with my ax. I&#8217;ll have that scalp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not so fast,&#8221; I warned. &#8220;The hair belongs to
Crabtree here. Kill your own scalps. Crabtree
doesn&#8217;t care to take that scalp. He knows Oconostota
has a long memory.&#8221; And I swung about, my
rifle across the saddle and in a direct line with the
murderer&#8217;s chin.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my kill,&#8221; growled Crabtree. &#8220;Morris held
me up with his gun, or I&#8217;d bagged t&#8217;other two of
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see him hold me up when there&#8217;s red
meat to be run down!&#8221; snarled Runner.</p>
<p>There were four killers present in addition to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
irresponsible Kirst. I was helpless against them,
I could not shoot a man down for proposing to follow
two Indians, let the reds be ever so friendly
toward the whites. But Patrick Davis had come to
Howard&#8217;s Creek to stay, and it was a problem he
could handle. It at once developed that he did not
fancy the prospect of a Cherokee reprisal. He
stepped in front of Runner and in a low ugly voice
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You fellows quit this talk. &#8217;Nough mischief has
been done. Unless Oconostota can be smoothed
down there&#8217;ll be trouble from Rye Cove to Tygart&#8217;s
Valley. As for following t&#8217;other two, you&#8217;ll reckon
with me and my neighbors first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A dead Injun ain&#8217;t worth quarreling over,&#8221;
spoke up Widow McCabe from the edge of the
group; and her eyes glowed as they rested on
Cherokee Billy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Moulton now came on the scene. She still
had her husband, and she frantically called on her
friends to prevent further bloodshed. The greater
number of the men, while unwilling to criticize Crabtree
for his dastardly murder, did not care to add
to the Cherokees&#8217; anger, and they took sides with
Davis. I believed the whole affair had ended, but
Crabtree was crafty, and he caused fresh fear by
reminding them:</p>
<p>&#8220;You folks are fools to let the only witnesses to
that dawg&#8217;s death git away and take word back
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
to the Cherokees. If Morris hadn&#8217;t took a hand
there wouldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; been that danger.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many settlers were long used to classifying the
red men with the wild animals along the border.
Therefore, the question of killing the two fleeing
Cherokees became a matter of policy, rather than
of sentiment. But Davis, although he wavered, finally
declared he would have none of it. He reminded
his friends that they would soon be called
by Dunmore to march against the Ohio tribes, and
that it would not do to leave hostile Cherokees behind
them to attack the valleys. Hacker, Runner,
Scott and Crabtree perceived that the settlers were
opposed to further bloodshed, but Crabtree still had
a card to play. Turning to Baby Kirst, who was
staring intently down on the dead man, he suddenly
cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet sugar, Baby, if you ride and find two Injuns
just gone away.&#8221;</p>
<p>And he pointed in the direction taken by the man
and woman. With a yelp of juvenile delight Baby
slapped his horse and rode away down the valley.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you&#8217;ve done it!&#8221; growled Davis, scowling
blackly at Crabtree. &#8220;You&#8217;ve made trouble atween
us and the Cherokees, and you&#8217;ve drove away the
best defense against Injuns we could &#8217;a&#8217; had.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have to have no loose-wit to stand &#8217;tween
me and Injuns,&#8221; sneered Crabtree.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re better at killing unarmed Indians than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
in putting up a real fight,&#8221; I accused. &#8220;You&#8217;re not
fond of traveling very far from a settlement when
you draw blood. Shelby Cousin was telling me
down on the Cheat that you like to be near a white
man&#8217;s cabin when you make a kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>His sallow face flushed red, but he had no harsh
words to say against young Cousin. Without replying
to me he made for the Davis cabin to get
something to eat, leaving Cherokee Billy for others
to bury. I noticed it was the Widow McCabe, with
her slate-gray eyes half-closed and gleaming
brightly, who waited on Crabtree and heaped his
plate with food.</p>
<p>What with the interruptions and the nervous tension
of the men it was after sunset before the roof
of the fort was finished. It was agreed that the
men with families should sleep in the fort that night
with the single men occupying the cabins nearest
the fort. I took up my quarters in the Davis cabin,
after reminding my friends again that I must start
early in the morning to cross the mountains on my
way to Colonel Lewis who lived near Salem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, land sake! To Salem! Why, look here!
You&#8217;ll be seeing my cousin, Ericus Dale!&#8221; excitedly
exclaimed Mrs. Davis.</p>
<p>My emotion was far greater than that expressed
by Mrs. Davis, but the dusk of early evening permitted
me to conceal it. It was three years since I
had seen the Dales, father and daughter. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
were then living in Williamsburg. It was most astonishing
that they should be now living in Salem.
But this was going too fast.</p>
<p>It did not follow that Patricia Dale was in Salem
because her father was there. In truth, it was difficult
to imagine Patsy Dale being content with
that little settlement under the eastern eaves of the
mountains. Before I could find my tongue Mrs.
Davis was informing her neighbors:</p>
<p>&#8220;My cousin, Ericus, ain&#8217;t got many warm spots
in his heart for Governor Dunmore. He&#8217;s sure to
be sot ag&#8217;in&#8217; this war. He&#8217;s a very powerful man
in the colony.&#8221; Then to me, &#8220;I want you to see
Patsy and tell her not to think of coming out here
this summer. She&#8217;s not to come till the Injuns have
been well whipped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming out here?&#8221; I dully repeated.</p>
<p>&#8220;They was opinin&#8217; to when I last got word from
&#8217;em last March. They was at their home in Williamsburg,
and the girl wrote she was going to
Salem with her father, who had some trading-business
to fix up. &#8217;Spected to be there all summer,
and was &#8217;lowing to come out here with her daddy.
But seeing how things is going, it won&#8217;t do. Mebbe
Salem even won&#8217;t be safe for &#8217;em. It won&#8217;t put you
out any to see her and tell her?&#8221;</p>
<p>I trusted to the dusk to conceal my burning
cheeks. I had supposed I had secured control of
myself during my three years on the border. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
would be impossible for any man who had looked
into Patsy Dale&#8217;s dark blue eyes to forget her; and
we had been something more than friends. I promised
Mrs. Davis I would do her errand, and hurried
from the cabin.</p>
<p>The ride ahead of me suddenly became momentous.
I was thrilled with the prospect of seeing
Patsy again; and I was afraid the interview would
disturb me vastly. To be alone and arrange my
jumbled thoughts I helped drive the horses into a
small inclosure, well stockaded, and watched the
boys coming through the clearing to drive the cattle
into their stalls in several hollow sycamores.
These natural shelters, once the openings were enlarged
and protected with bars, made excellent pens
for the domestic animals and fowls. I was still
thinking about Patsy Dale and the time when her
young life touched mine when the cabin doors were
barred and it was time to sleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>OVER THE MOUNTAINS</h3>
</div>

<p>When I opened my eyes a young man was surveying
the clearing through a chink above
the door. This morning vigilance was customary in
every cabin along the frontier and revealed the settler&#8217;s
realization of the ever present danger. No
wonder those first men grew to hate the dark forest
and the cover it afforded the red raiders. A
reconnaissance made through a peephole could at
the best satisfy one that no stump in the clearing
concealed an Indian.</p>
<p>It was with this unsatisfactory guarantee that the
settler unbarred his door. He could never be sure
that the fringe of the woods was not alive with the
enemy. And yet young men fell in love and amorously
sought their mates, and were married, and
their neighbors made merry, and children were born.
And always across the clearing lay the shadow of
the tomahawk.</p>
<p>Now that I am older and the blood runs colder,
and the frontier is pushed beyond the mountains, I
often wonder what our town swains would do if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
they had to risk their scalps each time a sweetheart
was visited!</p>
<p>The man at the door dropped back to the puncheon
floor, announcing: &#8220;All clear at my end.&#8221;</p>
<p>A companion at the other end of the cabin made
a similar report, and the door was opened. Two of
the men, with their rifles ready, stepped outside and
swiftly swung their gaze along the edge of the forest.
The early morning mists obscured the vision
somewhat. A bell tinkled just within the undergrowth.
Instantly the fellows outside dropped behind
stumps, while we inside removed the plugs
from loopholes.</p>
<p>&#8220;All the cattle is in,&#8221; murmured a youth to me,
so young his first beard had barely sprouted. &#8220;Injun
trick to git us out there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several minutes passed, then Davis loudly called
from the fort:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right! Hodge&#8217;s critter wa&#8217;n&#8217;t fetched in
last night.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the cow emerged from the
bushes.</p>
<p>Smoke began issuing from the cabin chimneys
and the women came from the fort to warm up the
remains of the pot-pies, to bake corn bread and prepare
mush. The men scattered through the clearing.
Some chopped down bushes which might mask
a foe&#8217;s stealthy advance, others cleared out logs
which might serve as breastworks for the raiders.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span></p>
<p>Labor did not appeal to the four killers, and their
part was done when they slipped into the forest,
each taking a different course, and scouted for
signs and bagged some game. As my business demanded
an early departure I was not expected to
participate in any of these precautions.</p>
<p>I saw that my horse had his feed and water and
led him back to the cabin, and gave my weapons
their daily overhauling. Mrs. Davis paused in her
labors long enough to remind me of her message to
Patricia Dale. I reassured her so earnestly that she
turned from her corn-bread baking in a flat pan before
the open fire and stared at me rather intently.
There was no dodging her keen eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;See here,&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;you&#8217;ve met Patsy
already, I &#8217;low.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hesitated between the truth and a lie, and then
nodded my head. She brushed a limp strand of
hair from her face, and in so doing left a smut-streak
across her nose, and half-closed her eyes
while a smile tugged at the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say yet whether you&#8217;re lucky, or just the
opposite,&#8221; she demurely remarked.</p>
<p>A loud call from the forest relieved my answering
this insinuating remark, and I stepped outdoors
to find the men leaving their work and the women
leaving their cooking. &#8220;White man coming!&#8221;
bawled a young man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t any of the scouts,&#8221; said Davis. &#8220;Better
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
gather the children in. White man sure enough,
but it may be one of the renegade breed. Surveyors
from the Kanawha say Tavenor Ross is out with
the reds ag&#8217;in.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no haste or confusion in preparing for
this possible attack led by a white man. The children
scuttled to their mothers; the men slowly fell
back to fort and cabins. The fact that four Indian-haters
were carefully scouting the woods satisfied
us that no enemy could get very close without being
fired upon. The white man called again. This
time he was answered from two directions.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right,&#8221; shouted Davis. &#8220;Ike Crabtree
answered him. So did Lige Runner. Crabtree
never would &#8217;a&#8217; yipped till sure there wa&#8217;n&#8217;t no Injun
waiting to be shot down. Prob&#8217;ly some one
from the Holston.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; howled a seventeen-year-old lad, who
painted his face in addition to wearing Indian leggings.
&#8220;It&#8217;s Jesse Hughes!&#8221;</p>
<p>His endorsement of the passionate, reckless man
evoked more enthusiasm from the younger men
than from their elders. So implacable was Hughes
in his hatred of the natives that he was incapable of
any self-restraint. His participation in the massacre
of the Bulltown families had made him a well-known
character wherever Indian-fighters met.</p>
<p>Crabtree loved to kill Indians, but he always
weighed his chances and never scorned an advantage.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
Hughes killed on sight, whether in a settlement
or in the woods, whether the act brought one
or a score of dusky avengers on his trail. Nor did
it matter if the Indian be friendly to the whites and
known to be perfectly harmless. His skin condemned
him.</p>
<p>Although a master of woodcraft and possessing a
knowledge of western Virginia equaled by few men,
Hughes was never asked to lead a command of rangers
sent to rescue prisoners, or punish a village. He
was too irresponsible. He would imperil the lives
of a score of friends bent on a surprise attack by
firing upon the first savage he saw.</p>
<p>The young men saw in him the successful killer.
Their elders preferred to travel the forests without
him. His presence in a settlement once war came
to the frontier, however, was always desirable, as in
case of a fight he would do the enemy much damage.</p>
<p>When he rode from the forest the four scouts
came with him; and there was no question as to
their admiration of the fellow. Greetings were
called out by men and women. He saw me mounted
and some one told him of my journey. He rode
up to me and warned me to be watchful as he had
found tracks a few miles south of the mountain-trace
I proposed following.</p>
<p>His errand at Howard&#8217;s Creek was to secure a
few men and attempt to cut off this band. Eager
queries for news induced him to say he had just
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
come from Clinch River, and that Captain William
Russell, in charge of the rangers along the Clinch,
had started Daniel Boone and Michael Stoner for
the Falls of the Ohio to warn the surveyors along
the river that the Indians were out and would soon
be attacking the frontier and combing the Kentucky
country clean.</p>
<p>With much gusto he added that three Cherokees
had been killed recently at the head of the Clinch.
The thoughtless, in unison with Hacker and his
companions, cheered this announcement most lustily.
The men with families looked very grave. Of
Baby Kirst, Hughes had seen no signs.</p>
<p>His report of Indian-signs near my route over
the mountains influenced me to return to the cabin
and check up my ammunition more carefully. I
spread a double handful of small bullets on the table,
running seventy to the pound, and let each slip
through my fingers to make sure none was irregular.
Only those which were round and smooth
were returned to the pouch.</p>
<p>My flints and greased linen patches were examined
a second time. An aged man, known as Uncle
Dick, came in and watched me curiously, and
grinned in approval of my caution. It was seldom a
man reached his advanced age on the frontier. I
had never heard Uncle Dick&#8217;s last name, nor do I believe
there was any one on the creek who had heard
it.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>According to rumor he had gone against some
law in South Carolina and had fled to the frontier.
Despite his many years he was sturdy and strong,
but his failing eyesight made him dependent upon
knife and ax. Much travel in wet weather had
crippled him with rheumatism, and he remained
close to whatever settlement he happened to visit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fill the breast o&#8217; yer shirt with hunks o&#8217; corn
cake, younker. Be sure yer ax is hitched so it won&#8217;t
be snagged from the loop when ye ride hellitiflicker
through the bushes,&#8221; he warned me.</p>
<p>I nodded, and he seated himself on a three-legged
stool and whetted a long knife against one of the
fireplace stones, and mumbled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make no differ about me, but for the sake
o&#8217; these younkers here such men as love killin&#8217; Injuns
oughter keep clear o&#8217; the settlements an&#8217; do
their stent on t&#8217;other side the Ohio. Old Cornstalk&#8217;s
powerful keen to git them fellers. When he
hears they&#8217;re here at the creek he&#8217;s likely to strike
quick an&#8217; mighty pert. Wal, if they come an&#8217; I can
make it hand-grips with &#8217;em I &#8217;low there&#8217;ll be some
new Injuns in the Happy Huntin&#8217;-grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I bid the people good-by and received their
kindly wishes for a safe journey, Uncle Dick was
still at the fireplace, trying to improve the razor-edge
of his blade.</p>
<p>I rode through the woods without spending any
time in looking for signs. Runner and his mates
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
had scouted a circle around the clearing in a thorough
fashion, and I could spare my eyes until I
reached the first slope of the mountains. When the
path began to ascend and I was afforded a better
view of the heavens, thunder-clouds were piling in
sullen massiveness above the western horizon.</p>
<p>The heat was very oppressive. The dull rumble
of thunder came across the valley behind. It was
as much of a vibration as a sound, something to be
felt as well as heard. The song-birds were keeping
close to the thickets and fluttering about nervously.
By the time I was well committed to the first rugged
ascent, a yellowish gray wall filled the western
sky. Across this the lightning played.</p>
<p>As the curtain of rain drove in toward the Greenbriar
I knew that any savages lurking west of Howard&#8217;s
Creek would be bothered to keep their priming
dry. No rain fell on my path, however, and at no
time did I lose the early morning sun. On gaining
a higher elevation I could see the storm was following
the valley down to the head waters of the
Clinch.</p>
<p>I had not neglected Uncle Dick&#8217;s advice in regard
to provisions, and the front of my loose hunting-shirt
held a bag of corn cakes and some cooked
venison. On reaching the first slope I had watched
carefully for the tracks Hughes had seen south of
the trace, but found none.</p>
<p>There could be no question of Hughes&#8217; ability to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
read Indian-signs; and his warning recalled the
Grisdols to my mind. These people&mdash;two brothers
and two children&mdash;had their cabin in a hollow close
by a tumbling brook and to one side of the trace.
I planned to make a slight détour and pass a word
with them and to warn them to be watchful.</p>
<p>The fact that Hughes had found signs near the
mountains would indicate the Indians had planned
a raid against some isolated home, and as there was
no footing in the trace I followed, it might easily
be that the enemy had entered lower down.</p>
<p>Along toward the noon hour I topped a ridge and
decided I would halt and eat at the first spring or
brook I came to. My horse, an old campaigner in
wilderness work, pricked his ears as we began dipping
down the gentle slope. I studied the path
ahead and the timbered slopes on both sides to discover
the cause of this attention.</p>
<p>The animal was intelligent. I knew it could be
no wild creature as there was no suggestion of fear
in the attentive ears. Dissatisfied at remaining in
ignorance, I reined in to investigate more carefully.
Almost at once the horse swung his head to the right
and gazed curiously. On this side the space was
bordered by a beech grove. Owing to the rank
bush-growth lining the path, little could be seen of
the grove from any point below where I had halted
until a brook, which cut the path, was reached.</p>
<p>I leaned forward and looked between the horse&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
ears and discovered a bear down in the hollow, nosing
about for nuts and grubs on the bank of the
brook. A bear was always acceptable meat to a settler,
and I at once decided to stalk the brute and
pack his carcass to the Grisdol cabin.</p>
<p>After the first moment he passed behind some
trees, but as I continued to glimpse him I knew he
had not taken alarm. I slid from my horse and
started him down the trace, and then ducked into
the grove and rapidly descended toward the brook.
I had no fear of my horse losing himself, as he
would make for the stream where I would join him
within a few minutes.</p>
<p>As I flitted from tree to tree I repeatedly sighted
the animal as he poked his nose about in search of
ants or grubs, and yet when I reached a point within
sixty or seventy-five yards of where he should
have been feeding I could not locate him.</p>
<p>A half-formed suspicion popped into my mind
from nowhere. My horse had shown no nervousness
in drawing nearer to the bear. The bushes
prevented my seeing the horse, but I could hear him
as he quickened his pace to reach the tumbling
brook. Now for a second I saw the bear again,
and my suspicion grew stronger.</p>
<p>The brute impressed me as being very lean, whereas
the season was enough advanced to have grown
some fat on his bones. I was fairly startled next
to behold the creature emerge from behind a tree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
and walk upright toward the opening made by the
brook, cutting across the trace. Had I not been
partly primed for the surprise I should have been
astounded at my second discovery; the bear was
armed with a gun.</p>
<p>Expecting to behold me on the horse when the
animal reached the brook the fellow&#8217;s only thought
was to remain unseen by any one in the trace. He
halted behind a tree, but in full view of me, and
standing with his left side exposed to me. Had I
the instincts of a killer I would have shot him forthwith,
and as he was obviously stalking me, having
discovered I was traveling over the trace, I would
have been justified. As it was I whistled shrilly.</p>
<p>Like a flash the bearskin fell back and a painted
Shawnee wheeled to face me. Even as he turned
his smoothbore banged away and half a dozen
buckshot rained through the branches over my head.
He was slipping behind the tree when I fired.</p>
<p>He went down with a foot and part of his leg exposed.
Controlling an impulse to close in I reloaded,
taking great care in wrapping the greased patch
about the bullet. I believed I had done for him,
but to make sure I sent another pellet through the
exposed foot. It twitched, as a dead limb will, but
without muscular reaction. Reloading, and circling
warily to avoid being taken by surprise by any companion,
I reached the beech. My first shot had caught
him through the base of the neck, killing instantly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span></p>
<p>He wore a necklace of bear&#8217;s claws and was hideously
painted. He had the snake totem on his
chest and was nude except for his breech-clout and
moccasins. Fastened to his clout were four awful
exhibits of his predaceous success&mdash;four scalps.
One was gray, another streaked with gray, and two&mdash;oh,
the pity of it&mdash;were soft and long.</p>
<p>I removed them and placed them in the roll of
buckskin that I carried for moccasin-patches. And
my heart being hardened, I scalped the murderer
with never a qualm. No warning was longer needed
at the Grisdol cabin. The Indians had struck.</p>
<p>Furtively scanning the grove, I stole to the trace
where my horse stood fetlock-deep in the brook.
The dead warrior had known of my coming, or of
some one&#8217;s coming, and had had time to masquerade
as a bear. He had thought to catch his victim off
his guard.</p>
<p>The four scalps proved the raiders were out in
numbers, for a small party would not venture so far
east. But the dead warrior&#8217;s attempt to ambush me
in a bearskin also proved he was working alone for
the time being. Yet gunshots carry far, and I
might expect the Shawnees to be swarming into
the hollow at any moment.</p>
<p>Mounting my horse, I turned north, left of the
trace, and picked a course where no trail ran, and
from which I could occasionally catch a glimpse of
the path some fifty feet below. I discovered no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
signs of the enemy, and there was no way of telling
whether they were ahead or behind me. That they
must have heard the roar of the smoothbore and
the whip-like crack of my Deckhard was not to be
doubted. Nor would they fail to guess the truth,
inasmuch as the rifle had spoken last.</p>
<p>It became very difficult to keep along the side of
the slope and I dismounted and led the horse. The
prolonged howl of a wolf sounded behind. My
horse was greatly afraid of wolves, yet he did not
draw back and display nervousness. I increased my
pace, then halted and half-raised my rifle as there
came a shuffling of feet above me, accompanied by
a tiny avalanche of forest mold and rotten chestnuts.
I rested the rifle over the saddle and endeavored
to peer through the tangle of beech and inferior
growth which masked the flank of the slope.</p>
<p>The sliding, shuffling sound continued with no
attempt at concealment that I could discover; and
yet there was nothing to shoot at. Suddenly the
noise ceased. I was still staring toward the spot
where it had last sounded when a calm voice behind
me called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was Shelby Cousin, with the hate of the border
making his young face very hard and cruel.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been scouting &#8217;em,&#8221; he informed me. &#8220;I
seen you take to the side o&#8217; this ridge. I seen &#8217;em
streamin&#8217; down the trace. They picked up your
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
trail mighty smart. Now they&#8217;re scattered all
along behind you.&#8221;</p>
<p>I opened the roll of buckskin and disclosed the
terrible trophies. He straightened and threw his
head back, and for a moment stood with his eyes
closed, his slight figure trembling violently. Then
he fiercely whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;How&#8217;d you git these from the devils?&#8221;</p>
<p>There was an expectant glare in his gaze. I
showed him the hair of the Shawnee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! Good!&#8221; he repeated exultantly as he
gloated over the repulsive thing. Then gloomily:</p>
<p>&#8220;But why couldn&#8217;t I &#8217;a&#8217; took it? Luck&#8217;s been
ag&#8217;in&#8217; me for days. Found a burned cabin after I
quit you on the Cheat, an&#8217; &#8217;lowed to ambush the
party when they made for the Ohio. &#8217;Stead o&#8217; goin&#8217;
to their villages they fooled me by strikin&#8217; across to
here. Now they&#8217;ve made this kill! Who be they?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Grisdols. Only a short distance from here.
Two men and the two children. No women. I
knew them. I must go there and bury them and
these scalps.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help,&#8221; he mumbled. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t heard no discovery-yell
yet. They&#8217;re still huntin&#8217; for your signs
along this ridge.&#8221; Trailing his double-barrel rifle,
he took the lead and began a diagonal descent to
the trace I had abandoned. I murmured a protest,
but he assured me:</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re all behind us. We can make quicker
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
time in the trace. They&#8217;ll hop on to your trail sure&#8217;s
shootin&#8217;. Speed is what we hanker for.&#8221;</p>
<p>His woodcraft was remarkable. He seemed to
possess the gift of seeing that which was concealed.
With a glance he would observe land formations
and the nature of the growth, and confidently circle
a heavy grove and tell me what would be the
nature of the traveling beyond, and whether wet or
dry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could slide down into the trace in a minute
any time, but I don&#8217;t want to take to it till we round
the bend ahead; then we&#8217;ll be out o&#8217; sight o&#8217; the reds
strung along the ridge.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had halted as he explained this and I was almost
abreast of him, and he startled me by whipping
up his rifle and firing. As the shot rang out
he rejoiced:</p>
<p>&#8220;One!&#8221;</p>
<p>I had heard nothing, seen nothing, and yet he
had both heard and seen, and had made his kill.</p>
<p>&#8220;No use coverin&#8217; up any longer,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;They&#8217;re closin&#8217; in. Make for the trace shortest
way. Hold back once you hit it for me to come up.
There&#8217;s not more&#8217;n two or three close at hand, but
the whole kit an&#8217; b&#8217;ilin&#8217; know we&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>The spiteful <i>spang</i> of his rifle barely interrupted
the woods life close about us. Only for a moment
did the squirrels cease their chatter. A grouse
drummed away in alarm, but only for a short flight.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
No cries of rage, nor war-whoops, warned that the
enemy were closing in on us. Had I been new to
the border I should have disbelieved my companion&#8217;s
statement. Leading the horse, I started down
the bank while Cousin climbed higher.</p>
<p>It was not until my horse slid down a ten-foot
bank that I heard a hostile sound&mdash;the rush of
many feet through last year&#8217;s dead leaves. I heard
the Deckhard fired once, and instantly the side of
the ridge was as quiet as a death-chamber. Then
came the scream of a panther, Cousin&#8217;s way of announcing
a kill.</p>
<p>They must have attempted rushing him, thinking
his rifle was empty; for he fired again, and once
more gave voice to his war-cry. Then the old eternal
quiet of the forest dropped back in place. Until
I heard a Shawnee scalp-cry I could rest easy as to
my companion. I slipped into the trace and mounted,
and pushed ahead.</p>
<p>The Indians were abreast of me and there was the
danger of their cutting into the trace ahead. That
they had not followed at my heels made me believe
they were concentrating all their energies on making
a surround and killing, or capturing their much
feared enemy. They would prefer to dance Cousin&#8217;s
scalp than to dance a dozen of men of my caliber.</p>
<p>There were no more shots up the ridge, and I
found it hard to decide just what gait I should permit
my horse to take. I could not leave the boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
behind, nor did I care to risk being intercepted. I
was worrying my mind into a fine stew over this
point when the bushes stirred ahead. I dropped to
the ground behind the horse, but it was young
Cousin. He motioned for me to hurry.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dodged them!&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Hoof&#8217;s band. They&#8217;re hard to dodge,&#8221;
he whispered, striding rapidly along and swinging
his head from side to side. &#8220;How far to the Grisdol
cabin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two miles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then ride for it. I&#8217;ll run at your stirrup. We&#8217;ll
need that cabin if it ain&#8217;t been burned. I &#8217;low it&#8217;ll
be a close race.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was no sign of pursuit. I was no novice
in Indian warfare, but in this instance I scarcely believed
the Shawnees would draw near enough to
make the chase interesting. So far as I could observe
Cousin had succeeded in stealing away from
them, and there was no Indian who could overtake
him, especially if he ran at my stirrup.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve took four sculps on this side the valley,&#8221;
he murmured as he loped along at my side. &#8220;I
bagged three on &#8217;em. You fetched one. Black
Hoof is too big a chief to call it quits. He&#8217;s back
there leadin&#8217; the chase. So I &#8217;low it&#8217;ll be close.&#8221;</p>
<p>A curious little thrill chilled my spine. Catahecassa,
or Black Hoof, was one of the most redoubtable
and resourceful savages to be found in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
Shawnee nation. If below Cornstalk&#8217;s intellectual
plane he made up for much of any such discrepancy
by his fiery courage and deep cunning.</p>
<p>The long-drawn howl of a wolf sounded up the
slope on our left and was soon answered by a similar
call directly in our rear. For a third time the
signal menaced us, on our right and at a considerable
distance.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re still scoutin&#8217; the ridge for me,&#8221; murmured
Cousin, his lean face turning to the left.
&#8220;The heft of &#8217;em are comin&#8217; along the trace behind
us. Those over to the right are hustlin&#8217; to find out
what&#8217;s up. We must git along faster!&#8221;</p>
<p>My mount responded eagerly, for he sensed the
danger. And it was wonderful to observe how
Cousin kept up, with one hand on my stirrup, the
other holding the rifle. We were well beyond the
brook where I shot my Shawnee, and within half
a mile or less of the Grisdol cabin, when our flight
was interrupted for a few moments by the behavior
of my horse.</p>
<p>It was just as we turned from the main trace to
strike into the path leading to the cabin that the
animal bolted sidewise, crowding Cousin deep into
the bushes. I reined in and stared down on a terrible
sight&mdash;that of the four Grisdols. They lay
in the path, head to head, in the form of a cross. I
felt my stirrup shake as Cousin&#8217;s hand rested on it.
He gave a little gasping sob and whispered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;How near to the cabin now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Less than half a mile,&#8221; I told him as I soothed
my horse and permitted him to pick his way around
the dead.</p>
<p>Once more we were off, but now Cousin ran behind,
for the way was winding and narrow, and at
places the overhanging boughs tried to brush me
from the saddle.</p>
<p>There was no need of glancing back to make sure
my companion was keeping up, for his impatient
voice repeatedly urged me to make greater speed.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the cabin ain&#8217;t standin&#8217; we&#8217;ve got to have
&#8217;nough of a lead to let us lose &#8217;em in the woods,&#8221; he
reminded.</p>
<p>The path completed a détour of some tangled
blackberry bushes and ended in a natural opening,
well grassed.</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is! The roof is partly burned!&#8221; I
encouraged.</p>
<p>&#8220;The walls stand. The door&#8217;s in place. Faster!&#8221;</p>
<p>Across the opening we raced. From the woods
behind arose a ferocious yelling. The Shawnee
were confident they had driven us into a trap. We
flashed by two dead cows and some butchered hogs,
and as yet I had not seen an Indian except the one
masked in a bear&#8217;s pelt. The cabin roof was
burned through at the front end. The door was
partly open and uninjured.</p>
<p>It was simple reasoning to reconstruct the tragedy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
even while we hastened to shelter. The family
had offered resistance, but had been thrown into
a panic at the first danger from fire. Then it was
quickly over. Doubtless there had been something
of a parley with the usual promise of life if they
came out. The fire crackled overhead, the victims
opened the door.</p>
<p>Cousin said they had been conducted to the main
trace before being slaughtered. As I leaped from
my horse a fringe of savages broke from cover and
began shooting. Cousin dropped the foremost of
them. I led the horse inside the cabin and my companion
closed and barred the door.</p>
<p>The interior of the place mutely related the tragic
story. It is the homely background of a crime that
accents the terrible. On the table was the breakfast
of the family, scarcely touched. They had
been surprised when just about to eat. An overturned
stool told how one of the men had leaped to
bar the door at the first alarm. I spied through a
peephole but could see nothing of our foes. A low
cry from Cousin alarmed me. He was overcome at
the sight of a small apron.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d stuck to the open,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;The air o&#8217; this place chokes me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can stand them off till night we can send
the horse galloping toward the woods to draw their
fire. Then we can run for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There won&#8217;t be no darkness to-night,&#8221; morosely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
replied Cousin. &#8220;They&#8217;ll make big fires. They&#8217;ll
try to burn us out. We&#8217;re well forted till they git
the roof blazin&#8217; ag&#8217;in. We&#8217;ll &#8217;low to stick here
s&#8217;long we can. They won&#8217;t dare to hang round too
long.&#8221;</p>
<p>He took a big kettle from the fireplace and thrust
it through the hole in the roof. Bullets whistled
overhead, with an occasional <i>whang</i> as a piece of
lead hit the kettle and ricochetted. After the first
volley the Indians refused to waste their ammunition,
either realizing it was useless, or suspecting
the kettle was some kind of a trick.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;lowed they&#8217;d git tired,&#8221; muttered Cousin,
sticking the top of his head into the kettle and lifting
the edge a crack so he could scrutinize the forest.
After a minute of silence his muffed voice called
down to me: &#8220;Had a notion that cow we passed
nearest the woods was dead. Try a shot that&#8217;ll just
graze the rump.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fired and a Shawnee began rolling toward the
bushes. The iron kettle rattled to the ground, and
young Cousin, with head and shoulders thrust
through the roof, discharged both barrels of his
rifle. The Indian stopped rolling. I was amazed
that Black Hoof&#8217;s men had not instantly fired a
volley. I exclaimed as much as he dropped to the
floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here she comes!&#8221; he cried as the lead began
plunging into the thick logs. &#8220;If they keep it up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
we can dig quite a lot o&#8217; lead out the timbers. It
took &#8217;em by surprise to see me comin&#8217; through the
roof, an&#8217; it surprised &#8217;em more to see two shoots
comin&#8217; out of a gun that hadn&#8217;t been reloaded.
Mighty few double barrels out here. Huh! I
&#8217;low somethin&#8217; cur&#8217;ous is goin&#8217; to happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could discern nothing to warrant this prophecy.
No Indians were to be seen. Cousin called my attention
to the sound of their tomahawks. I had
heard it before he spoke, but I had been so intent in
using my eyes that I had forgotten to interpret
what my ears were trying to tell me. There was
nothing to do but wait.</p>
<p>Cousin discovered the horse had drunk what
water there had happened to be in the bucket, leaving
us scarcely a drop. Half an hour of waiting
seemed half a day; then something began emerging
from the woods. It resolved itself into a barrier of
green boughs, measuring some fifteen feet in length
and ten feet in height.</p>
<p>Its approach was slow. The noise of the axes
was explained. The Indians had chopped saplings
and had made a frame and filled it with boughs.
Behind it was a number of warriors. About half-way
across the clearing were half a dozen long logs
scattered about.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re thinkin&#8217; to make them logs an&#8217; while
hid by their boughs yank &#8217;em together to make a
breastwork. Then they&#8217;ll pepper us while &#8217;nother
party rushes in close. New party will pelt us while
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
the first makes a run to git ag&#8217;in&#8217; the walls where
we can&#8217;t damage &#8217;em from the loopholes. That
Black Hoof is a devil for thinkin&#8217; up tricks.&#8221;</p>
<p>I fired at the green mass. Cousin rebuked me,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t waste lead. There&#8217;s three braves with
long poles to keep the contraption from fallin&#8217; backward.
They&#8217;re on their feet, but keepin&#8217; low as
possible. There&#8217;s t&#8217;others pushin&#8217; the bottom along.
There&#8217;s t&#8217;others huggin&#8217; the ground. You&#8217;ll notice
the ends an&#8217; middle o&#8217; the top stick up right pert,
but between the middle an&#8217; each end the boughs
sort o&#8217; sag down. If the middle pole can be put out
o&#8217; business I &#8217;low the weight of it will make it cave
in. Loaded? Then don&#8217;t shoot less you see somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>With this warning he fired at the middle of the
screen, and the middle support developed a weakness,
indicating he had wounded the poleman. He
fired again, and the whole affair began to collapse,
and a dozen warriors were uncovered. These raced
for the woods, two of them dragging a wounded or
dead man.</p>
<p>For a few seconds I was incapable of moving a
muscle. I was much like a boy trying to shoot his
first buck. Or perhaps it was the very abundance
of targets that made me behave so foolishly. Cousin
screamed in rage. My bonds snapped, and I fired.
If I scored a hit it was only to wound, for none of
the fleeing foe lessened their speed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
&#8220;Awful poor fiddlin&#8217;!&#8221; groaned Cousin, eying me
malevolently.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what was the matter with me.
Something seemed to hold me paralyzed. Couldn&#8217;t
move a finger until you yelled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Better luck next time,&#8221; he growled, his resentment
passing away.</p>
<p>He loaded and stood his rifle against the logs and
began spying from the rear of the cabin. Whenever
he glanced at the apron his eyes would close for a
moment. No women had lived there. One of the
Grisdols, the father of the two children, had brought
it as a reminder of his dead wife. Cousin&#8217;s great
fight was not against the red besiegers, but against
his emotions. I knew he was thinking of his sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come here!&#8221; I sharply called. &#8220;They want a
pow-wow. One&#8217;s waving a green bough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cousin climbed to the hole in the roof, holding
his rifle out of sight by the muzzle. He yelled in
Shawnee for the man to advance alone. The warrior
strode forward, the token of peace held high.
So far as I could see he did not have even a knife
in his belt. Overhead Cousin&#8217;s rifle cracked and the
Indian went down with never a kick.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! You&#8217;ve fired on a flag of truce,
after agreeing to receive it!&#8221; I raged.</p>
<p>He stood beside me, a crooked smile on his set
face, his eyes gleaming with triumph, his shapely
head tilted to enjoy every note of the horrible anger
now welling from the forest. &#8220;You fired&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low I did,&#8221; he chuckled. Then with awful
intentness, &#8220;But the folks who lived here an&#8217; was
happy didn&#8217;t fire on the Injun fetchin&#8217; &#8217;em a bundle
o&#8217; peace-talk. They believed the Injuns meant it.
Do you reckon I treated that dog any worse than
the Shawnees treated my father and mother and
little sister ten years ago? If you don&#8217;t &#8217;low that,
just keep shet. When a Injun sends you a flag o&#8217;
truce you want to tie your scalp down, or it&#8217;ll blow
off.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chorus of howls in the forest suddenly ceased,
then were succeeded by sharp yelps of joy. Cousin
stared at me in bewilderment. Darting to the back
of the cabin, he peered through a chink. &#8220;Come
here,&#8221; he softly commanded. I joined him and took
his place at the peephole. There was a haze of
smoke in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why Black Hoof an&#8217; his men are hangin&#8217;
round here,&#8221; he sighed. &#8220;He sent a small band
farther east. They&#8217;ve made a kill. That&#8217;s a burnin&#8217;
over there.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be Edgely&#8217;s cabin,&#8221; I decided.
&#8220;But they moved back to Dunlap&#8217;s Creek three
months ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God for that!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;But we&#8217;ll
have more Injuns round us mighty soon. I wish it
was dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve stopped their yowling. Look out for
fresh deviltry!&#8221;</p>
<p>He nodded and walked to the front of the cabin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
The horse neighed shrilly. The call was repeated
in the forest. The Indians continued silent. I
heard it first; that is to recognize it. For I had
heard it the day before. The voice of a man shouting
fretfully, much as an angry child complains.
Cousin understood it when a whimpering note was
added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Baby Kirst!&#8221; he softly cried. &#8220;Black Hoof will
&#8217;low his medicine is mighty weak. Baby&#8217;s out there
an&#8217; in a bad frame o&#8217; mind. Somethin&#8217; is goin&#8217;
ag&#8217;in&#8217; the grain. It&#8217;s good medicine for us that he
wandered up this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>I began sketching the happenings at Howard&#8217;s
Creek, but before I could finish the bushes on the
hem of the woods were violently agitated and Baby
Kirst rode into the clearing, his horse in a lather.
When he beheld the dead cows and hogs he yelled
like a madman and plucked his heavy ax from his
belt, and turned back to the woods. He disappeared
with a crash, his hoarse voice shouting unintelligible
things.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now you can go,&#8221; quietly said Cousin as he
unbarred the door. &#8220;Be keerful o&#8217; the Injuns to
the east. They&#8217;ll be a small band. I &#8217;low I&#8217;ll foller
Kirst. If he don&#8217;t drive &#8217;em too fast there oughter
be good huntin&#8217; for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>That night I rode into the Greenwood clearing on
Dunlap&#8217;s Creek without having seen any Indians
along the way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>I REPORT TO MY SUPERIORS</h3>
</div>

<p>A night at the Greenwood cabin and I resumed
my journey to Salem on the Roanoke. Near
this hamlet lived Colonel Andrew Lewis, to whom
I was to report before carrying or forwarding Doctor
Connolly&#8217;s despatches to Governor Dunmore.
The trip was free from any incidents and seemed
exceedingly tame after the stress of over-mountain
travel. All the settlers I talked with were very
anxious to know the true conditions along the border.</p>
<p>As I pressed on and found the cabins more
thickly strewn along the various waters I was
impressed by the belief of many that the Cherokees
would join the Ohio tribes before the war ended.
One would expect to find this apprehension to be
the keenest where the danger would be the greatest.
But not so. Whenever I related how Isaac Crabtree
had murdered Cherokee Billy, brother of the
powerful Oconostota, the pessimists were positive
that the Cherokee nation would lay down a red
path.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span></p>
<p>Notwithstanding these natural fears the war
remained popular with practically all the men with
whom I talked. Various companies were being
formed, and militia captains, to make sure of seeing
active service, were not punctilious as to where
and by what means they secured their men. There
was much ill-natured bickering over this rivalry,
with several matters assuming such proportions that
only Colonel Lewis could straighten them out.</p>
<p>The war was popular because the people realized
a farther western expansion would be impossible
until the Indians had been crowded back and firmly
held behind the Ohio. Anything short of a permanent
elimination of the red menace was cried
down.</p>
<p>Much resentment was felt against the hotheads in
Pennsylvania for openly accusing the Virginians of
inciting the war to establish their land claims. It
was widely known that the Pennsylvania <i>Gazette</i>
had published charges against Doctor Connolly to
the effect that his agents, acting under his orders,
had fired on friendly Shawnees who were escorting
white traders into Fort Pitt. Among these settlers
east of the mountains the common complaint was
about the scarcity of powder and lead.</p>
<p>When within a few miles of my destination I
came upon a group of settlers who were gathered
about a travel-stained stranger. For the first time
since leaving Dunlap&#8217;s Creek I found myself of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
second importance. This man was tanned by the
weather to a deep copper color and wore a black
cloth around his head in place of a cap.</p>
<p>I halted on the edge of the group and waited for
him to finish his narrative which must have been
of lively interest if the rapt attention of the men
and women was any gage.</p>
<p>&#8220;&mdash;and using the ax I jumped over his body, got
to the horse and rode away,&#8221; his deep voice concluded.
He spoke with a palpable effort and almost
with a sing-song intonation.</p>
<p>I dismounted and pressed forward, and told him:</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like an Indian.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God&#8217;s marcy, young sir!&#8221; cried an old dame.
&#8220;An&#8217;, please sweet grace, why shouldn&#8217;t he? Isn&#8217;t
he Johnny Ward, took by the Injums when a boy,
an&#8217; just managed to scoot free of &#8217;em?&#8221;</p>
<p>The man slowly looked me over, his face as immovable
as any Shawnee chief&#8217;s. Then with the
slightest of hesitation between each two words he
calmly informed me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Escaped as the white woman says. Named John
Ward. Indian name, Red Arrow. Now I am back
with my people. Now I am John Ward again. I
talk bad. I talked with Indians most the time all
these years. With my old friends I will grow to
talk better.&#8221;</p>
<p>I congratulated him on his return to civilization.
Many a man holding a high place in the colony&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
government and in the affection of the people had
been held in captivity; but few were the men who
returned after spending so many years with the
Indians. In that respect Ward&#8217;s case was unusual.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your talk sounds all right to us,&#8221; said one of
the men. &#8220;Mayhap you l&#8217;arned some things about
the red hellions that&#8217;ll help our boys to give &#8217;em
pepper.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can lead you to their towns by the shortest
trails. I can lead you to their new towns that
white men can not find quick,&#8221; he replied, after a
few moments&#8217; pause, just as an Indian would wait
before answering a question.</p>
<p>Young Cousin flashed into my mind, and I asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know of a white woman&mdash;she would be
nineteen years old now&mdash;named Cousin? She was
captured by Shawnees at Keeney&#8217;s Knob ten years
ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>For half a minute I was doubtful if he understood
my query. Then he shook his head. I was disappointed
as it seemed to be an excellent chance to
learn whether the girl be dead or alive. Still talking
in his peculiar, halting way, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;She, the white woman, was killed, probably. If
not that she would be taken to Detroit and sold.
Now married and living on a Canada farm, probably.
Whites taken prisoners were not let to see each
other. No whites were ever kept in the village
where I lived.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What village were you kept in?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;First in Lower Shawnee Town. Then in more
towns. As I grew old they took me to the towns
farthest from the Ohio. Then came a time when
I went where I pleased, but they never took me on
their war-paths south the Ohio.&#8221;</p>
<p>By this time the country folk began to remember
that I, too, was a newcomer, and should have much
information or gossip. They turned from Ward
and plied me with questions. I briefly recited for
the twentieth time since leaving Dunlap&#8217;s Creek
the conditions west of the mountains.</p>
<p>Detailed cross-examination brought forth the happenings
at Howard&#8217;s Creek and the murder of the
four Grisdols, and the firing of the Edgely cabin.
When I said that Black Hoof was in command of
the Grisdol raiders my audience displayed nervousness,
and more than one glance was cast toward the
west. The effect on Ward was pronounced, also.
Rising, he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa led that path? I must be going.
It was from his band I escaped. His warriors followed
me. I will go to the east before camping for
the night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll never dare come east of the mountains!&#8221;
loudly declared one of the men.</p>
<p>Ward&#8217;s face was inscrutable as he walked to his
horse. As he vaulted into the saddle he remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Hoof has a long arm.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span></p>
<p>So it happened that John Ward, the returned captive,
and I finished the distance to Salem. Temptation
assailed me as we reached the edge of the settlement.
I had planned all the time to finish my
business with Colonel Lewis at his home at Richfield.
I had planned this even after learning from
Mrs. Davis of the Dales&#8217; presence in Salem.</p>
<p>Now, of a sudden, it seemed that I must hunt
them up and look on Patricia once more. But Colonel
Lewis was waiting for me. I had endured
three years without a glimpse of the girl; and leaving
Ward to ride on and relate his experience to the
Salem people I skirted the town and pressed on to
Richfield.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Lewis home I was informed by
a colored man that the colonel was not at the house,
but somewhere about the grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; please goodness, massa, I&#8217;s gwine to fotch
him in two shakes of a houn&#8217; dawg&#8217;s tail,&#8221; he told
me.</p>
<p>I threw myself on the grass and waited. Either
the servant&#8217;s powers of &#8220;fotching&#8221; had been exaggerated,
or else the colonel was quite indifferent to
my arrival. Nearly an hour passed before my
meditations were interrupted.</p>
<p>This was not my first visit to Richfield to report
to the colonel, but I felt no better acquainted at the
last meeting than at the first. There was a certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
reserve in his manner which held folks at arm&#8217;s
length. This impression of aloofness was increased
by his personal appearance. His tall figure and
stern dark eyes made for austerity.</p>
<p>In military affairs he was said to be overstrict in
discipline; this from those who had served under
him in former wars. Yet he stood very high in
the esteem of the county militia and his superiors.
Perhaps his severe mien was the natural result of a
life filled with stormy experiences. From early manhood
he had been employed in fighting Indians.</p>
<p>He was a captain of militia at the age of twenty-two.
Twelve years later he was a major, serving
under Colonel George Washington. He was seriously
wounded at Fort Necessity. He would have
played a prominent part in Braddock&#8217;s first and last
Indian battle had he not been detailed to complete
a chain of frontier forts. He was in the disastrous
Sandy Creek expedition the year following Braddock&#8217;s
defeat.</p>
<p>In 1758 he was an officer under Forbes, and was
one of those captured with Grant&#8217;s detachment. He
escaped the stake only to be held a prisoner in Montreal.
Later he led a force against the Cherokees;
and in Pontiac&#8217;s War he commanded two hundred
and fifty riflemen under Colonel Bouquet. Now
he was picked to command one of the two armies
that Governor Dunmore proposed to send against
the Indian towns above the Ohio.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></p>
<p>Among the Indians the name of Lewis stood
very high. The natives knew the colonel to be the
son of that John Lewis who was long famed as an
Indian fighter. It was commonly believed by red
and white, and I have no reason to doubt the truth
of it, that it was John Lewis who introduced red
clover to America.</p>
<p>Whether he did or did not, the Ohio Indians
credited him with planting the first seed and said
the color resulted from the blood of the red men
he had slain. William and Charles Lewis, the colonel&#8217;s
brothers, also were noted border men.
Charles undoubtedly ranked as high for courage
and astuteness as any frontiersman in Virginia.</p>
<p>The colored man at last turned the corner of the
house. Behind him, and not yet in sight, was the
colonel, and he was not alone for I could hear his
grave voice addressing some companion.</p>
<p>&#8220;De c&#8217;unel dat stubbo&#8217;n I jes&#8217; have to talk mighty
plain &#8217;fore I could make him pudge erlong,&#8221; proudly
whispered the servant as he passed me.</p>
<p>I sprang to my feet, and Colonel Lewis and His
Excellency, John Murray, Earl of Dunmore, our
royal governor, leisurely strolled into view.</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis wore no wig and was smoking a
pipe, of which he was inordinately fond. It was
characteristic of him to be more democratic and
careless in personal presentment when with his
superiors than when meeting the rough and ready
people of the border.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>Nor was Governor Dunmore given to set forms.
He was forty-two years of age and in his prime, a
man among men. He could be most democratic,
and on this day there was none of the town beau&#8217;s
fastidiousness in his dress. Yet his wig and his
coat were a mode in themselves, while his shoe, knee
and stock buckles were of gold. Ultra-genteel
young bucks would have had such buckles set with
brilliants, that they might twinkle and glitter at
every mincing step.</p>
<p>His Excellency walked with a man&#8217;s stride and
gave the impression of being careless in dress,
whereas, in fact, he always was perfect in his points.
He dominated his attire and left you scarcely conscious
of it. The two of them had been discussing
something with great earnestness for as they drew
near me the colonel gestured with his pipe-stem, and
His Excellency pushed back his wig and appeared
inclined to disagree.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord, man! I tell you it&#8217;s their cursed provincial
jealousy. They malign the man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, I am not the judge,&#8221; Colonel
Lewis calmly replied. &#8220;I simply repeat what I hear,
and suggest how it may be disastrous to the campaign.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Jealousy and slander!&#8221; heatedly declared the
governor. Then his lively gaze rested on me. He
frowned, as if trying to remember, then smiled with
that graciousness he could so charmingly display
when he deemed it worth while and said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been keeping you from your guest, Colonel.
He looks brown and lean enough to have traveled
far and to have brought a pretty earful. I know
the face and ought to be calling him by name.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis advanced a few steps and bowed
slightly, and refreshed the governor&#8217;s recollection
by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;He is Basdel Morris, Your Excellency. Of
Prince William County originally. Before Your
Excellency came to Virginia he came out here to act
as scout and messenger between us and Fort Pitt.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fort Dunmore,&#8221; coldly corrected the governor,
giving the name bestowed in honor of his earldom.
Then with a genial smile:</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember Mr. Morris distinctly. He has
brought papers to me. I vow but he should have
a good budget of news. If we could retire to the
shade and escape this cursed heat&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Inside, inside,&#8221; brusquely interrupted the colonel,
and he waved us through the door with his pipe-stem.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll find it cool in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>And we did; and very pleasant too, and with
many little comforts for those who wish to be indolent,
such as foot-rests, and low tables for holding
decanter and glasses and a sheaf of long pipes and
some of Virginia&#8217;s superb tobacco.</p>
<p>&#8220;No ceremony here, Mr. Morris. Sit down, man.
We will play His Lordship is traveling in disguise.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Forsooth! He has that which we are hungry to
receive! It&#8217;s more fit we should stand while he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
takes his ease,&#8221; gaily exclaimed His Excellency.
And he removed his wig and mopped his cropped
poll and sipped appreciatively of the tall glass a
soft-footed servant placed at his elbow.</p>
<p>This was a most pleasing trait about His Excellency,
and one which in happier times should have
endeared him even to people who have small use for
earls. He could make the young or diffident man
feel more at home than could the democratic and
autocracy-hating Andrew Lewis. Nor was it any
affectation; for we were soon to learn he could keep
up with hardy borderers on long forest marches, and
at that, proceed afoot and carry his own blanket and
equipment like any backwoods volunteer.</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis shot a glance at me and then at
the governor, and I verily believed his dark eyes
were laughing at one of us. Surely not at me, for
I was too insignificant. I obtained an inkling as
to the cause of his cynical amusement when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Young Mr. Morris, while not forest-bred, has
lived long enough in the woods as to make him
blunt of tongue. Would Your Excellency prefer
that he make a verbal report to me and that I reduce
it to writing for your consideration?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After what the Quakers have said I find my skin
to be very thick except when it comes to something
touching my personal honor,&#8221; coldly replied the
governor. &#8220;Let the man tell what he will. We
want the truth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Until this moment I had barely opened my mouth.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Now I produced the despatches committed to my
care by Doctor Connolly. In presenting these to
Governor Dunmore I remained standing, waiting to
be dismissed.</p>
<p>His Excellency, however, made no move to open
and read his despatches, but fell to staring at me
speculatively. Finally he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s have the personal side&mdash;the things you
observed on your journey back here.&#8221; And he
motioned for me to be seated.</p>
<p>I told them of Bald Eagle&#8217;s murder, and His
Excellency exhibited hot anger, and broke in on my
recital long enough to exclaim:</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse their black hearts! I drove John Ryan out
of the country for murdering on the Cheat, Ohio,
and the Monongahela. I&#8217;ve had others arrested, and
their crazy neighbors have released them. I offer
rewards for still others, and they come and go unmolested!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s unfortunate that some of our border
men are as murderous as the Indians,&#8221; quietly
agreed Colonel Lewis. His Excellency subsided
and nodded for me to continue.</p>
<p>I next spoke of young Shelby Cousin, and the
colonel&#8217;s eyes grew hard as I related the youth&#8217;s
lament over his little sister, and, in his behalf, urged
that some effort be made to ascertain the girl&#8217;s fate.
The governor wrinkled his nose and brows in an
effort to remember something. Then he said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I knew the name was familiar. I&#8217;ve sent word
to Connolly to seek traces of the girl through the
different traders. The war has closed that line of
inquiry, I fear, as the traders have come in, or have
been slaughtered. Very sad case. Very sad. The
young man should go to England to begin life anew
and learn to forget. I shall arrange it for him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would die before he would quit the woods,
Your Excellency,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;If he did consent
and did go to England he would die of homesickness
inside of ten days. Either that, or he would
try to swim back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather a poor opinion of England&#8217;s charms,&#8221;
remarked the governor.</p>
<p>When I took up the general scarcity of powder
and lead and described how handicapped the settlers
were by the lack of these vital necessities, it was
Colonel Lewis&#8217;s turn to show the most feeling.</p>
<p>His anger was almost passionate, and none the
less impressive because he held it in check. Staring
wide-eyed at the governor he concluded his outburst
by demanding:</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it, Your Excellency?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about it? Why, that&#8217;s something to ask
of the House of Burgesses, wound all up in their red
tape. His gracious Majesty suggested in &#8217;sixty-three
that insomuch as the colonies implored England&#8217;s
aid against the French and Indians they
should contribute something toward the cost of their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
defense in that war. Methinks they have taken the
suggestion as an affront.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The French War is ten years old. It was
fought so that England might gain Canada. Virginia
is still a royal province and her people need
powder and lead,&#8221; the colonel replied. Perhaps he
stressed &#8220;still&#8221; a bit. At least the governor&#8217;s gaze
dropped and concealed any impression he might
have received.</p>
<p>The governor drummed his fingers on the low
liquor-stand, then lifted his head and stated:</p>
<p>&#8220;This war will never be won by isolated groups
of settlers fighting on the defensive along the many
creeks and rivers. The decisive blow will be struck
by the two armies soon to take the field. There
will be plenty of powder for the men I lead and the
men you are to lead. As to the back-country settlements,
the House of Burgesses should have provided
for them. His Majesty is eager to aid all his subjects,
but there&#8217;s scant policy in serving our powder
and balls to be husbanded along the western slope
of the Alleghanies and perhaps later used against
England&#8217;s soldiers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis dropped his pipe and stared
wrathfully at his noble guest. With an effort he
restrained his temper and rejoined:</p>
<p>&#8220;The talk seems to touch upon some war other
than that with the Ohio tribes.&#8221;</p>
<p>His Excellency at once was all smiles and graciousness.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
Leaning forward and placing a hand on
the colonel&#8217;s knee, he earnestly declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;The conversation has wandered, foolishly on my
part, I admit. I have lacked in tact, but the first
fault I swear is due to the attitude of the Burgesses
in neglecting to take proper measures for
defending the frontier. Before England can send
sufficient supplies to Virginia this war will have
ended. There is plenty of powder at Williamsburg.
Why doesn&#8217;t the House of Burgesses send it to the
border?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is but a small store at the most, Your
Excellency.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why retain it when it is needed elsewhere?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is hardly a question I can answer,&#8221; was the
stiff reply. Then with a flash of heat:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a shame! We repeatedly urge those families
to stick, not to come off their creeks until
they&#8217;ve laid by their corn and harvested their oats;
and they are denied the simple means of defending
their lives. Whether the Burgesses or the royal
governor be at fault the fact remains that the settlers
pay in blood and anguish.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is any powder at Williamsburg or Norfolk
that I can lay hands to, it shall go over the
mountains. At least the royal governor will prove
his hands are clean,&#8221; solemnly declared His Excellency.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll warrant that Pennsylvania has traded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
enough guns and powder to the Shawnee and
Mingos,&#8221; moodily observed the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s too much talk in Williamsburg over
peoples&#8217; rights, and not enough concern for peoples&#8217;
lives,&#8221; declared His Excellency. &#8220;It would be a
good thing if the House of Burgesses could be
locked up in a fort and made to repel an Indian
attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, well,&#8221; sighed the colonel, &#8220;we&#8217;ll never
lick the Ohio tribes with proclamations and empty
hands.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By gad, sir! We&#8217;ll whip them with powder and
lead! I&#8217;ve set myself to the task of crushing the
Indian power. It shall be done!&#8221;</p>
<p>They settled back and signaled for me to resume
my narrative. When I mentioned Crabtree and
the other killers both the governor and the colonel
expressed a wish that the Indians might catch them,
or else scare them from the border. I closed my
story by speaking of John Ward, the returned captive.
The military instinct of both my hearers was
instantly aroused; for here was a source of inside
information our spies could not hope to provide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Find that man and send him here,&#8221; ordered the
governor. &#8220;But before you go tell us something of
conditions about Fort Dunmore. You seem to have
skipped that.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was what I had expected, and I did not
relish the task. Had I been talking alone with Colonel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
Lewis it would have been the first topic I had
touched upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency has Doctor Connolly&#8217;s despatches.
Doubtless they will give you much more
than I can,&#8221; I faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t any danger of your duplicating Doctor
Connolly&#8217;s information,&#8221; said His Excellency
sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;His Excellency desires to learn those odds and
ends which wouldn&#8217;t be included in an official
report, but which may throw some light on the
whole situation,&#8221; added the colonel, his gaze resting
on me very insistently. And somehow I knew he
wanted me to talk, and to speak plainly.</p>
<p>If I reported according to my sense of duty I
feared I was in for an unpleasant experience with
His Excellency. If I would ever receive any favors
from him it would be because I kept my mouth shut
and steered clear of dangerous ground. The situation
at Pitt, however, had offended me; and now
that I must speak I grew reckless and decided to
speak frankly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Arthur St. Clair, representing the Pennsylvania
proprietors, together with other eminent men in
that colony, publicly declared that Your Excellency
is in partnership with Doctor Connolly in various
land-deals,&#8221; I began.</p>
<p>&#8220;Doctor Connolly has acted as my agent, just as
his uncle, Michael Croghan, has acted for Colonel
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
George Washington,&#8221; easily remarked His Excellency.</p>
<p>&#8220;Croghan repudiates the acts of Connolly,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Dunmore frowned and spoke wide of the mark
when he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;What St. Clair and his friends see fit to believe
scarcely constitutes facts. But go on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They also say that this war with the Shawnees
is being hurried on for the purpose of establishing
our boundary-claims and making good our titles to
grants under Virginia patents.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Scarcely news. They&#8217;ve been howling that ever
since last April,&#8221; growled Lewis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been absent some months. I have no way
of knowing what you&#8217;ve heard, or haven&#8217;t heard.
I&#8217;m afraid I have nothing new in the way of facts
or gossip,&#8221; I said, and my face flushed.</p>
<p>Governor Dunmore laughed softly and good-naturedly
nodded for me to continue. I said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is commonly believed in Pennsylvania that
Connolly&#8217;s circular letter to our frontier was meant
to precipitate a war so that he might cover up the
costs of rebuilding Fort Pitt. It is said on all sides
that the commandant fears the House of Burgesses
will repudiate his expenditures even after Your
Excellency has endorsed them&mdash;providing there is
no war.&#8221;</p>
<p>The governor&#8217;s face colored, but his voice was
quiet as he said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Connolly may be a fool in many things, but he
is right about the House of Burgesses. There isn&#8217;t
any doubt as to their repudiating anything which
looks like a benefit to our frontier.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency, I can scarcely agree to that,&#8221;
cut in Colonel Lewis. It was the second time their
counter-views had struck out sparks.</p>
<p>Both remained silent for half a minute, each, I
have no doubt, controlling an impulse to explode.
Relations between the colonies and England
resembled an open powder-keg. With a bow that
might indicate he desired to avoid a dangerous subject
the governor shifted the conversation by
remarking:</p>
<p>&#8220;After all, it doesn&#8217;t matter what Pennsylvania
thinks, so long as we know her interests are hostile
to Virginia&#8217;s. I am governor of Virginia. I will
serve her interests, and by gad! if the Quakers don&#8217;t
like our way they can chew their thumbs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are one in that!&#8221; heartily cried the colonel.</p>
<p>Governor Dunmore frowned down at his gold
shoe-buckles and wearily said:</p>
<p>&#8220;They say I want war. But the Williamsburg
paper has insisted on this war since last March.
Truth is, the border wants the war. And let me
confess to you, Colonel Lewis, that the Earl of
Dartmouth, as Secretary of State for the colonies,
will express His Majesty&#8217;s great displeasure to me
before this war is over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;England does not want his campaign to go
through. Taking the position I have means I will
meet with disfavor and criticism at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turning to me, he querulously complained.</p>
<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s you people along the border who make
the war necessary. It&#8217;s the horrible massacres of
harmless Indians that brought the trouble upon me.&#8221;</p>
<p>This was grossly untrue and I countered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Even Logan doesn&#8217;t claim that. It&#8217;s been give
and take as to the killings, with the Indians getting
the better of it in scalps. A general war can
result only from the Indians&#8217; belief that our settlers
are crossing the mountains to settle in the Kentucky
country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah! There you go! True to the dot, too!&#8221; he
cried. &#8220;You Americans are restless. You acquire
no attachment to any place. Wandering about
seems to be engrafted in your natures. It&#8217;s your
great weakness that you should forever be thinking
the lands farther off are better than those on which
you&#8217;re already settled.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But land-grants on the Ohio are worthless without
settlers,&#8221; I meekly reminded. Colonel Lewis
indulged in a frosty smile. His Excellency eyed
me shrewdly, and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course the lands must be settled sometime.
The trouble comes from the frontier people&#8217;s failure
to understand that His Majesty&#8217;s government
has any right to forbid backwoodsmen from taking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
over any Indian lands which happen to hit the
fancy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They have no idea of the permanent obligation
of treaties which His Majesty&#8217;s government has
made with the various Indian nations. Why, some
of the frontier people feel so isolated from the colonies
that they wish to set up democratic governments
of their own. A pretty kettle of fish! Then
such creatures as this Crabtree murder such men as
the brother of the powerful Cherokee chief. More
trouble for the border.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall offer a reward of a hundred pounds for
Crabtree&#8217;s arrest. If he is arrested the border men
will release him. And yet they demand that His
Majesty supply them with powder to defend their
homes. Good God! What inconsistency! And
as if we did not have enough trouble inside our
colony there is Mr. Penn, to the north. As proprietary
governor he sullies the dignity of his communications
to the House of Representatives by
making the same a conveyance of falsehood, thereby
creating trouble between Pennsylvania and Virginia.</p>
<p>&#8220;He is even now trying to make my Lord Dartmouth
believe that my zeal in carrying on this war
is not through any sense of duty to my king, but
because of a desire for personal emoluments. If
he can make the people of Virginia believe that,
then I am helpless.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
Certainly this defense of his motives was not
meant to convert me. My ideas worried His Excellency
none. He was testing Colonel Lewis, whose
reserve made the broaching of delicate subjects
very much of a difficulty. The colonel quickly declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Excellency knows that I thoroughly understand
the true bias of Pennsylvania. We are
with you in this war heart and soul. But I do
think, to put it mildly, that Doctor Connolly has
been indiscreet.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had come back to the one phase of the conversation
which interested him. The governor
hesitated a moment, then asked me:</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your personal opinion of Doctor Connolly?
Speak freely.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I consider him to be a very ambitious, intriguing
man, and very much of a fire-eater.&#8221;</p>
<p>Both the gentlemen smiled, His Excellency being
less genuine than the colonel. &#8220;To be an ambitious
fire-eater is not a bad quality in these times,&#8221; said
the governor. &#8220;As to intrigue, so long as it is for
Virginia I will not condemn it too strongly. What
other charges are there in your arraignment?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not arraign him,&#8221; I retorted. Believing I
had gone too far ever to retrieve myself in the governor&#8217;s
good graces, and being made angry by the
thought, I boldly continued: &#8220;Connolly is too autocratic.
He carries things with too high a hand. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
takes measures which neither Your Excellency, nor
any other of His Majesty&#8217;s governors would dream
of indulging in. He arrests and imprisons citizens
without any pretense at legal procedure. It is
because of such actions that many in Pennsylvania
expressed the wish we might lose the war. I will
add that I heard no such expressions of ill-will since
the white families were murdered along the Monongahela.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It does make a difference as to whose ox is
being gored,&#8221; grimly commented Colonel Lewis.</p>
<p>&#8220;Does Pennsylvania still blame Michael Cresap
for the death of Logan&#8217;s people?&#8221; asked the governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of them do, because Connolly reduced him
in rank. His reinstatement at Your Excellency&#8217;s
command is not so generally known.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Confusion and bickering!&#8221; wrathfully exclaimed
the governor. &#8220;Virginia demanding a decisive
war&mdash;England opposed to it. Our militia captains
stealing each other&#8217;s men&mdash;Sir William Johnson&#8217;s
death is most untimely.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sir William Johnson dead! For the moment I
was stunned. My facial expression was so pronounced
that His Excellency kindly added:</p>
<p>&#8220;The sad news has just reached us. Never was
he needed more and wanted more. The colonies
have been so used to having him hold the Iroquois
in check that few have paused to picture what might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
happen if his influence were removed from the Six
Nations.&#8221;</p>
<p>He rose and paced the room for a few turns.
Then with a short bow to me he addressed the
colonel, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;With your permission, Colonel, I believe I shall
retire for an hour. When the man Ward comes I
wish to question him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;By all means, Your Excellency, take a bit of
rest. I shall call you if the fellow comes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I turned to go and the colonel walked with me to
the door, urging me to return and remain his guest
that night. I thanked him, explaining an acceptance
of his kind offer would depend on circumstances.
He walked with me to my horse and with a side-glance
at the house softly inquired:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do the people over the mountains and in
Pennsylvania say about the Quebec Bill now before
Parliament?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not remember hearing it mentioned. I do
not think any of the settlers are interested in it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not interested!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;And if it is approved<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
by Parliament the American colonies will
be robbed of hundreds of thousands of square miles
of territory. They will lose the lands which already
have been given them in their own charters. Think
of Virginia and Pennsylvania quarreling over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
junction of two rivers when we stand fair to lose
all the country west of the Alleghanies. Young
man, there&#8217;s going to be war.&#8221; This was very
softly spoken.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in it now,&#8221; I stupidly replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am speaking of war with England,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>I could scarcely accept it as being a true prophecy.
I was not disturbed by it. The quarreling between
colonies and the mother-country was an old story.
Hiding my skepticism I asked, &#8220;When will it
begin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It began in 1763, when the English Ministry
decided to collect revenues from the colonies,&#8221; was
the quiet reply. &#8220;It will soon be open war. I
verily believe I am entertaining in my humble home
to-day the last royal governor of Virginia.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LOVE COMES A CROPPER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;I am speaking of a war with England.&#8221; These
words of Colonel Lewis rang in my ears as I
rode to Salem. They had sounded fantastic when
he uttered them. Now that I was alone they repeated
themselves most ominously. The flying
hoofs of my horse pounded them into my ears.
War with England was unthinkable, and yet the colonel&#8217;s
speech lifted me up to a dreary height and
I was gazing over into a new and very grim world.</p>
<p>For years, from my first connected thoughts,
there had been dissension after dissension between
England and America. My father before me had
lived through similar disputes. But why talk of
war now? Many times the colonies had boiled over
a bit; then some concession was made, and what
our orators had declared to be a crisis died out and
became a dead issue.</p>
<p>To be sure another &#8220;crisis&#8221; always took the
place of the defunct one, but the great fact remained
that none of those situations had led to war. Perhaps
if some one other than Colonel Lewis had
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
indulged in the dire foreboding it would have made
less of an impression. At the time he spoke the
words I had not been disturbed. Now that I was
remembering what an unemotional level-headed
man he was the effect became accumulative. The farther
I left Richfield behind and the longer I mulled
over his sinister statement the more I worried.</p>
<p>As I neared Salem my meditations continued disquieting
and yet were highly pleasing. I was on
my way to meet Patricia Dale. I was born on the
Mattapony and left an orphan at an early age. I
had gone to Williamsburg when turning sixteen,
and soon learned to love and wear gold and silver
buckles on a pewter income.</p>
<p>In my innocence, rather ignorance, I unwittingly
allowed my town acquaintances to believe me to be a
chap of means. When I discovered their false estimate
I did not have the courage to disillusion them.
My true spending-pace was struck on my eighteenth
birthday, and inside the year I had wasted my King
William County patrimony.</p>
<p>Just what process of reasoning I followed during
that foolish year I have never been able to determine.
I must have believed it to be imperative that
I live up to the expectations of my new friends. As
a complement to this idiotic obsession there must
have been a grotesque belief that somehow, by accident
or miracle, I would be kept in funds indefinitely.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
I do recall my amazement at the abrupt ending of
my dreams. I woke up one morning to discover I
had no money, no assets. There were no odds and
ends, even, of wreckage which I could salvage for
one more week of the old life.</p>
<p>Among my first friends had been Ericus Dale and
his daughter, Patricia. To her intimates she was
known as Patsy. As was to be expected when an
awkward boy meets a dainty and wonderful maid,
I fell in love completely out of sight. At nineteen
I observed that the girl, eighteen, was becoming a
toast among men much older and very, very much
more sophisticated than I.</p>
<p>She was often spoken of as the belle of Charles
City County, and I spent much time vainly wishing
she was less attractive. Her father, engaged in the
Indian-trade, and often away from home for several
months at a time, had seemed to be very kindly disposed
to me.</p>
<p>I instinctively hurried to the Dales to impart the
astounding fact that I was bankrupt. One usually
speaks of financial reverses as &#8220;crashing about&#8221;
one&#8217;s head. My wind-up did not even possess that
poor dignity; for there was not enough left even
to rattle, let alone crash.</p>
<p>The youth who rode so desperately to the Dale
home that wonderful day tragically to proclaim his
plight, followed by fervid vows to go away and
make a new fortune, has long since won my sympathy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
I have always resented Ericus Dale&#8217;s attitude
toward that youth on learning he was a pauper.
It is bad enough to confess to a girl that one has not
enough to marry on; but it is hell to be compelled
to add that one has not enough to woo on.</p>
<p>How it wrung my heart to tell her I was an impostor,
that I was going to the back-country and
begin life all over. Poor young devil! How many
like me have solemnly declared their intentions to
begin all over, whereas, in fact, they never had
begun at all.</p>
<p>And why does youth in such juvenile cataclysms
feel forced to seek new fields in making the fresh
start? Shame for having failed, I suppose. An
unwillingness to toe the scratch under the handicap
of having his neighbors know it is his second trial.</p>
<p>But so much had happened since that epochal day
back in Williamsburg that it seemed our parting had
been fully a million years ago. It made me smile
to remember how mature Patsy had been when I
meekly ran her errands and gladly wore her yoke
in the old days.</p>
<p>Three years of surveying, scouting and despatch-bearing
through the trackless wilderness had aged
me. I prided myself I was an old man in worldly
wisdom. Patsy Dale had only added three years
to her young life. I could even feel much at ease
in meeting Ericus Dale. And yet there had been
no day during my absence that I did not think of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
her, still idealizing her, and finding her fragrant
memory an anodyne when suffering in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The sun was casting its longest shadows as I
inquired for the house and rode to it. If my heart
went pit-a-pat when I dismounted and walked to
the veranda it must have been because of anticipation.
As I was about to rap on the casing of the
open door I heard a deep voice exclaim:</p>
<p>&#8220;This country&#8217;s going to the dogs! We need the
regulars over here. Using volunteers weakens a
country. Volunteers are too damned independent.
They&#8217;ll soon get the notion they&#8217;re running things
over here. Put me in charge of Virginia, and I&#8217;d
make some changes. I&#8217;d begin with Dunmore and
wind up with the backwoodsmen. Neither Whigs
nor Tories can save this country. It&#8217;s trade we
want, trade with the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>I could not hear that any one was answering him,
and after a decent interval I rapped again. At last
I heard a slow heavy step approaching from the cool
twilight of the living-room.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye? You have business with me, my man?&#8221;
demanded Dale, staring into my face without appearing
to recognize me. He had changed none that
I could perceive. Short, square as though chopped
out of an oak log. His dark hair still kinked a bit
and suggested great virility. His thick lips were
pursed as of old, and the bushy brows, projecting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
nearly an inch from the deep-set eyes, perhaps had a
bit more gray in them than they showed three years
back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ericus Dale, you naturally have forgotten me,&#8221;
I began. &#8220;I am Basdel Morris. I knew you and
your daughter three years ago in Williamsburg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, young Morris, eh? I&#8217;m better at remembering
Indian faces than white. Among &#8217;em so
much. So you&#8217;re young Morris, who made a fool
of himself trying to be gentry. Sit down. Turned
to forest-running, I should say.&#8221; And he advanced
to the edge of the veranda and seated himself. He
had not bothered to shake hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had business with Colonel Lewis and I wished
to see you and Patsy before going back,&#8221; I explained.
I had looked for bluntness in his greeting,
but I had expected to be invited inside the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pat&#8217;s out,&#8221; he mumbled, his keen gaze roaming
up and down my forest garb. &#8220;But she&#8217;ll be back.
Morris, you don&#8217;t seem to have made much of a hit
at prosperity since coming out this way.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dependent only on myself,&#8221; I told him.
&#8220;Personal appearance doesn&#8217;t go for much when
you&#8217;re in the woods.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ain&#8217;t it the truth?&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;In trade?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Carrying despatches between Fort Pitt and Governor
Dunmore just now. Surveying before that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, by Harry, sir! You could be in better
business,&#8221; he snapped. &#8220;What with Dunmore at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
the top, and thieving, land-grabbing settlers at the
bottom, this country is going to the devil! Dunmore
cooks up a war to make a profit out of his
land-jobbing! Settlers quit good lands on this side
the mountains to go land-stealing in the Kentucky
country and north of the Ohio. It riles my blood!
I say you could be in better business than helping
along the schemes of Dunmore and that trained
skunk of his, Jack Connolly.&#8221;</p>
<p>I smiled pleasantly, beginning to remember that
Ericus Dale was always a freely spoken man.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean that there is no need of this war?
You say it is cooked up.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Need of war?&#8221; he wrathfully repeated. &#8220;In
God&#8217;s mercy why should we have war with the
Indians? All they ask is to be let alone! Ever see
a single piaster of profit made out of a dead Indian
unless you could sell his hair? Of course not. The
Indians don&#8217;t want war. What they want is trade.
I&#8217;ve lived among &#8217;em. I know. It&#8217;s Dunmore and
the border scum who want war. They want to steal
more land.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had no wish to quarrel with the man, but I, too,
had been among the Indians; and I could not in
decency to myself allow his ridiculous statements to
go unchallenged.</p>
<p>&#8220;How can the country expand unless the settlers
have land? And if the Indians block the trail how
can we get the land without fighting for it? Surely
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
it was never intended that five or more square miles
of the fairest country on earth should be devoted to
keeping alive one naked red hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>He fairly roared in disgust. Then with an effort
to be calm he began:</p>
<p>&#8220;Land? Settlers? You can&#8217;t build a profit on
land and settlers. Why, the colonies already refuse
to pay any revenue to England. Line both sides of
the Ohio with log cabins and stick a white family
in each and what good does it do? Did the French
try to settle Canada? No! The French weren&#8217;t
fools. They depended on trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But they lost Canada,&#8221; I reminded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah! For a purely military reason. The future
of this country is trade. England&#8217;s greatness is
built up on trade.&#8221; His trick of jumping his voice
on that word &#8220;trade&#8221; was very offensive to the
ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania has the right idea. Pennsylvania
is prosperous. Pennsylvania doesn&#8217;t go round chopping
down bee-trees and then killing the bees to get
the honey. What good is this land over here if
you can&#8217;t get fur from it? Settlers chop down the
timber, burn it, raise measly patches of corn, live
half-starved, die. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>
<p>His crazy tirade nettled me. It was obvious I
could not keep in his good books, even with Patricia
as the incentive, without losing my self-respect. I
told him:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span></p>
<p>&#8220;This country can never develop without settled
homes. We&#8217;re building rudely now, but a hundred
years from now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yah!&#8221; And his disgust burst through the thick
lips in a deep howl. &#8220;Who of us will be alive a
hundred years from now? Were we put on earth
to slave and make fortunes for fools not yet born?
Did any fools work and save up so we could take
life soft and easy? You make me sick!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Mr. Dale, to hear you say that. However,
the war is here&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The war may be here, in Virginia, among the
backwoodsmen. It is also in Dunmore&#8217;s heart, but
it ain&#8217;t in the hearts of the Indians,&#8221; he passionately
contradicted. &#8220;The Indians only ask to be let alone,
to be allowed to trade with us. Some canting hypocrites
are whining for us to civilize the Indians.
Why should they be civilized? Do they want to be?
Ever hear of Indians making a profit out of our
civilization? Did the Conestoga Indians make a
profit when they tried to live like the whites near
Lancaster, and the Paxton boys killed fourteen
of them, men, women and children, then broke into
the Lancaster jail where the others had been placed
for their safety, and butchered the rest of them?</p>
<p>&#8220;Did the ancient Virginia Indians prosper by
civilization? I reckon if the old Powhatans could
return they&#8217;d have some mighty warm things to say
on that score. Why shouldn&#8217;t the Indians insist we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
live as they do? They were here first. The only
way to help the Indian is to trade with him. And
when you help him that way you&#8217;re helping yourself.
That&#8217;s the only point you can ever make a red man
see.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know the Indians. I can go into their towns
now, be they Cherokee, Mingo, Shawnee or Delaware,
and they&#8217;ll welcome me as a brother. They
know I don&#8217;t want their land. They know I&#8217;m their
true friend. They want me to make a profit when
I trade with them, so I&#8217;ll come again with more
rum and blankets and guns, and gay cloth for their
women.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You have the trader&#8217;s point of view, and very
naturally so,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank God I ain&#8217;t got the land-grabber&#8217;s point
of view! Nor the canting hypocrite&#8217;s point of
view! Nor a thick-headed forest-runner&#8217;s point of
view!&#8221; he loudly stormed, rising to end the discussion.</p>
<p>But I was not to be balked, and I reminded him:</p>
<p>&#8220;I called to pay my respects to Mistress Dale. I
hope I may have the pleasure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s in the field back of the house. I&#8217;ll call
her,&#8221; he grumbled. &#8220;I have a man in my kitchen, a
white man, who has lived with the Indians ever
since he was a boy. He knows more about them
than all you border-folks could learn in a million
years. He&#8217;s the most sensible white man I ever
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
met. He agrees with me perfectly that trade is
what the Indian wants; not settlers nor Bibles.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Your guest would be John Ward!&#8221; I exclaimed,
remembering the governor&#8217;s errand. &#8220;I was asked
by Colonel Lewis to find him and send him to Richfield.
The colonel and Governor Dunmore wish to
talk with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ho! Ho! That&#8217;s the way the cat jumps, eh?
Want to milk him for military information, eh?
Well, I reckon I&#8217;ll go along with him and see they
don&#8217;t play no tricks on him. I&#8217;ve taken a strong
liking to Ward. He&#8217;s the one white man that&#8217;s got
my point of view.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He lived with the Indians so long he may have
the Indians&#8217; point of view,&#8221; I warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The sooner white men learn the Indians&#8217; point
of view the better it&#8217;ll be for both white and red.
Ward knows the Indians well enough to know I&#8217;m
their friend. He knows I&#8217;m more&#8217;n welcome in
any of their towns. I&#8217;m going to carry a talk to
Cornstalk and Black Hoof. If I can&#8217;t stop this war
I can fix it so&#8217;s there&#8217;ll never be any doubt who&#8217;s
to blame for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you, Dale, that no white men, except it be
Ward or Tavenor Ross and others like them, are
safe for a minute with Logan&#8217;s Cayugas, Cornstalk&#8217;s
Shawnees, Red Hawk&#8217;s Delawares, or Chiyawee&#8217;s
Wyandots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Three years ain&#8217;t even made a tomahawk improvement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
on you,&#8221; he sneered. &#8220;You mean to tell
me that after all my years of friendship with the
Indians I won&#8217;t be safe among them, or that any
friends I take along won&#8217;t be safe among them?
You talk worse&#8217;n a fool! I can send my girl alone
into the Scioto villages, and once she gives belts from
me she will be as safe as she would be in Williamsburg
or Norfolk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Such talk is madness,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;The one message
your cousin, Patrick Davis&#8217; wife, on Howard&#8217;s
Creek, asked me to deliver to your daughter
is for her not to cross the mountains until the Indian
trouble is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An old biddy whose husband is scared at every
Indian he sees because he knows he&#8217;s squatting on
their lands. My cousin may not be safe on Howard&#8217;s
Creek, but my daughter would be. I&#8217;ll say
more; once the Indians know I am at Howard&#8217;s
Creek, they&#8217;ll spare that settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was useless to argue with the man. It was
almost impossible to believe that he meant his
vaporings for seriousness. With a scowl he walked
to the rear of the house and entered the kitchen.
All the windows were open, and his voice was deep
and heavy. I heard him say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ward, I want you. We&#8217;re going to have a talk
with two white men, who don&#8217;t understand Indians.
Pat, that young cub of a forest-running Morris is
out front. Hankers to see you, I &#8217;low.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span></p>
<p>My leather face was still on fire when I heard
the soft swish of skirts. Then she stood before me,
more beautiful than even my forest-dreaming had
pictured her, more desirable than ever. She courtesied
low, and the amazing mass of blue-black hair
seemed an over-heavy burden for the slim white
neck to carry.</p>
<p>She smiled on me and I found my years dropping
away like the leaves of the maple after its first mad
dance to the tune of the autumn&#8217;s wind. I felt fully
as young as when I saw her in Williamsburg. And
time had placed a distance other than that of years
between us: it had destroyed the old familiarity.</p>
<p>To my astonishment we were meeting as casual
acquaintances, much as if a chin-high barrier was
between us. It was nothing like that I had pictured.
I had supposed we would pick up the cordiality at
the first exchange of glances. I stuck out my hand
and she placed her hand in it for a moment.</p>
<p>&#8220;Basdel, I would scarcely have known you.
Taller and thinner. And you&#8217;re very dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wind and weather,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;It was at Howard&#8217;s
Creek I learned you were here. I was very
anxious to see you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t stand.&#8221; And she seated herself and I
took a chair opposite her. &#8220;So nice of you to have
us in mind. It&#8217;s some three years since.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I reckon your father doesn&#8217;t fancy me much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s displeased with you about something,&#8221; she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
readily agreed. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t mind what he says.
He&#8217;s excitable.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I minded it I&#8217;ve forgotten it now,&#8221; I told her.
I now had time to note the cool creamy whiteness
of her arms and throat and to be properly amazed.
She had been as sweet and fresh three years before,
but I was used to town maids then, and accepted
their charms as I did the sunshine and spring flowers.
But for three years I had seen only frontier
women, and weather and worry and hard work had
made sad work of delicate complexions.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now tell me about yourself,&#8221; she commanded.</p>
<p>There was not much to tell; surveying, scouting,
despatch-bearing. When I finished my brief recital
she made a funny little grimace, too whimsical to
disturb me, and we both laughed. Then quite seriously
she reminded me:</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Basdel, your last words were that you were
to make a man of yourself.&#8221;</p>
<p>In this one sentence she tagged my forest work
as being valueless. Had I been the boy who rode
through the May sunshine frantically to announce
his poverty, I might have accepted her verdict as a
just sentence. Now there was a calculating light
in her dark blue eyes that put me on my mettle.
She was throwing down a red ax.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am self-dependent,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I never was that
in Williamsburg. I have risked much. Before
crossing the mountains, I did not dare risk even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
your displeasure. I have done things that men on
the frontier think well of. When you knew me back
East I only succeeded in making a fool of myself.
The carrying of despatches between Fort Pitt and
Botetourt County is considered to be rather important.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But, please mercy, there&#8217;s more important things
for young men to do than these you&#8217;ve mentioned,&#8221;
she softly rebuked.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the work of surveying lands for homes and
settlements, if the scouting of wild country to protect
settlements already established, if keeping a line
of communication open between the Ohio and the
James are not important tasks, then tell me what
are?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>She was displeased at my show of heat.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no call for your defending to me your
work over the mountains,&#8221; she coldly reminded.
&#8220;As an old friend I was interested in you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But tell me what you would consider to have
been more important work,&#8221; I persisted. &#8220;I honestly
believed I was working into your good opinion.
I believed that once you knew how seriously I was
taking life, you would be glad of me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Basdel,&#8221; she soothed. &#8220;I mustn&#8217;t scold
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Pitying me is worse,&#8221; I corrected. &#8220;If you can&#8217;t
understand a man doing a man&#8217;s work at least withhold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
your sympathy. I am proud of the work I
have done.&#8221;</p>
<p>This ended her softer mood.</p>
<p>&#8220;You do right to think well of your work,&#8221; she
sweetly agreed. &#8220;But there are men who also take
pride in being leaders of affairs, of holding office
and the like.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And going into trade,&#8221; I was rash enough to
suggest.</p>
<p>With a stare that strongly reminded me of her
father she slowly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;In trade? Why not? Trade is most honorable.
The world is built up on trade. Men in trade
usually have means. They have comfortable homes.
They can give advantages to those dependent upon
them. Trade? Why, the average woman would
prefer a trader to the wanderer, who owns only his
rifle and what game he shoots.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patsy, that is downright savagery,&#8221; I warmly
accused. &#8220;Come, be your old self. We used to be
mighty good friends three years ago. Be honest
with me. Didn&#8217;t you like me back in Williamsburg?&#8221;</p>
<p>The pink of her cheeks deepened, but she quietly
countered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Basdel, I like you now. If I didn&#8217;t I never
would bother to speak plainly to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Three years&#8217; picture-painting was turning out to
be dream-stuff. I tried to tell myself I was foolish
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
to love one so much like Ericus Dale; but the lure
was there and I could no more resist it than a bear
can keep away from a honey-tree.</p>
<p>She had shown herself to be contemptuous in
reviewing the little I had done. She was blind to
the glory of to-morrow and more than filled with
absurd crotchets, and yet there was but one woman
in America who could make my heart run away from
control. If it couldn&#8217;t be Patsy Dale it could be no
one.</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in Williamsburg, before I made such a
mess of my affairs, you knew I loved you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We were children&mdash;almost.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;ve felt the same about you these three
years. I&#8217;ve looked ahead to seeing you. I&#8217;ve&mdash;well,
Patsy, you can guess how I feel. Do I carry
any hope with me when I go back to the forest?&#8221;</p>
<p>The color faded from her face and her eyes were
almost wistful as she met my gaze unflinchingly,
and gently asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;Basdel, is it fair for a man going back to the
forest to carry hope with him? The man goes once
and is gone three years. What if he goes a second
time and is gone another three years? And then
what if he comes back, rifle in hand, and that&#8217;s all?
What has he to offer her? A home in the wilderness?
But what if she has always lived in town and
isn&#8217;t used to that sort of life?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But if she loves the man&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But what if she believes she doesn&#8217;t love him
quite enough to take him and his rifle and live in
the woods? Has he any more right to expect that
sacrifice than she has the right to expect him to leave
the forest and rifle and make his home where she
always has lived?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose not. But I, too, like the scenes and
things you like. I don&#8217;t intend spending all my life
fighting Indians and living in the forest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If your absence meant something definite,&#8221; she
sighed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning if I were in trade,&#8221; I bitterly said.</p>
<p>The kindly mood was gone. She defiantly exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;And why not? Trade is honorable. It gets one
somewhere. It has hardships but it brings rewards.
You come to me with your rifle. You talk sentiment.
I listen because we were fond of each other
in a boy-and-girl way. We mustn&#8217;t talk this way
any more. You always have my best wishes, but I
never would make a frontier woman. I like the
softer side of life too much.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you will not wait? Will not give me any
hope?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait for what? Another three years; and you
coming back with your long rifle and horse. Is
that fair to ask any woman?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. Not when the woman questions the fairness.
&#8216;Another three years&#8217; are your words, not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
mine. I shall see this war through, and then turn
selfish. What I have done is good for me. It will
serve to build on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure of it,&#8221; she agreed. &#8220;And you always
have my best&mdash;my best wishes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And down in your heart you dare care some, or
you wouldn&#8217;t talk it over with me,&#8221; I insisted.</p>
<p>&#8220;We liked each other as boy and girl. Perhaps
our talk is what I believe I owe to that friendship.
Now tell me something about our backwoods settlements.&#8221;</p>
<p>In story-writing the lover should, or usually does,
fling himself off the scene when his attempt at love-making
is thwarted. Not so in life with Patsy. I
believed she cared for me, or would care for me if
I could only measure up to the standard provided
for her by her father&#8217;s influence.</p>
<p>So instead of running away I remained and tried
to give her a truthful picture of border conditions.
She understood my words but she could not visualize
what the cabins stood for. They were so many
humble habitations, undesirable for the town-bred
to dwell in, rather than the symbols of many, happy
American homes. She pretended to see when she
was blind, but her nods and bright glances deceived
me none. She had no inkling of what a frontier
woman must contend with every day, and could she
have glimpsed the stern life, even in spots, it would
be to draw back in disgust at the hardships involved.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span></p>
<p>So I omitted all descriptions of how the newly
married were provided with homes by a few hours&#8217;
work on the part of the neighbors, how the simple
furniture was quickly fashioned from slabs and sections
of logs, how a few pewter dishes and the husband&#8217;s
rifle constituted the happy couple&#8217;s worldly
possessions. She wished to be nice to me, I could
see. She wished to send me away with amiable
thoughts.</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds very interesting,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Father
must take me over the mountains before we return
to town.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not ask him to do that,&#8221; I cried. And I
repeated the message sent by Mrs. Davis.</p>
<p>She was the one person who always had her own
way with Ericus Dale. She smiled tolerantly and
scoffed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Father&#8217;s cousin sees danger where there isn&#8217;t
any. No Indian would ever bother me once he know
I was my father&#8217;s daughter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patsy Dale,&#8221; I declared in my desperation. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
loved you from the day I first saw you. I love you
now. It&#8217;s all over between us because you have
ended it. But do not for your own sake cross the
mountains until the Indian danger is ended. Howard&#8217;s
Creek is the last place you should visit. Why,
even this side of the creek I had to fight for my life.
The Indians had murdered a family of four, two of
them children.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>She gave a little shudder but would not surrender
her confidence in her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think I intended going alone. I
know the Indians are killing white folks, and are
being killed by white folks. But with my father
beside me&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you love your father keep him on this side
of the Alleghanies!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You will make me angry, Basdel. I don&#8217;t want
to be displeased with you. My father has known
the Indians for years. He has warm friends in
every tribe. He is as safe among them as he is here
in Salem. And if Howard&#8217;s Creek is in danger he
can request the Indians to keep away from it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! Are you as blind as all that?&#8221; I
groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;Forest-running, Basdel, has made you violent
and rough in your talk,&#8221; she icily rebuked. &#8220;You
hate the Indians simply because you do not understand
them. Now I&#8217;m positive that the best thing
for you to do is to keep away from the frontier and
see if you can&#8217;t start right on this side of the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be folly to argue with her longer. I
fished a pair of moccasins, absurdly small, from the
breast of my hunting-shirt and placed them on the
table. I had bought them from a squaw in White
Eyes&#8217; village, and they were lavishly embroidered
with gay beads. The squaw had laughed when I
told the size I wanted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you will forget these came from the forest
and will let me leave them, I shall be pleased,&#8221; I
said. &#8220;If you don&#8217;t care for them, just chuck them
aside. I had to guess at the size.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, they are beautiful,&#8221; she softly exclaimed,
snatching them from the table. &#8220;Basdel, why not
stay on this side of the mountains? You&#8217;re a very
clever young man if you would only give yourself
a chance. Very soon you could go to the House of
Burgesses. If you don&#8217;t care to go into trade you
could speculate in land. Father is against it, but
if it will be done, you might as well do it as to
leave the cream for others.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I wished to stay, I could not,&#8221; I replied.
&#8220;I have much to do over there. Unfinished work.
I have promised Colonel Lewis to carry despatches
when not scouting. If they can send some one to
Fort Pitt in my place I shall serve as scout in the
Clinch River Valley. The people down there are
badly upset.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, giving yourself for others may be very
Christian-like. One must decide for one&#8217;s self,&#8221;
she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The people over there help one another. They
stand together. If I can help them, I shall be helping
myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish my father could go there and make them
see how silly they are,&#8221; she impatiently declared.
&#8220;If they would only be friendly with the Indians!
It is so simple&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I know a fellow about your age,&#8221; I broke in.
&#8220;The Indians killed his people on Keeney&#8217;s Knob
ten years ago and stole his little sister. He doesn&#8217;t
know whether she is dead or a captive. His folks
were friendly. They were butchered after making
a feast for Cornstalk and his warriors. There are
many such cases. It would do no good for your
father to tell young Cousin and others, who happened
to survive, that they are silly.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean they would resent it?&#8221; she
demanded, her chin going up in a very regal manner.</p>
<p>&#8220;He could scarcely change their opinions,&#8221; I
mumbled.</p>
<p>We were interrupted by a colored woman bustling
in with Colonel Lewis&#8217; servant in tow. The man
bowed profoundly before Patsy and then informed
me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please, Massa Morris, de c&#8217;unel &#8217;mires fo&#8217; to see
yo&#8217; at de house right erway. I &#8217;spects it&#8217;s business
fo&#8217; de gun&#8217;ner. De c&#8217;unel mos&#8217; &#8217;tic&#8217;lar dat say he
wants to see yo&#8217; to once. Yas, sah. Please, sah.&#8221;</p>
<p>I dismissed him with a word of my immediate attendance
on the colonel. Then I gave my hand to
Patsy and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;This ends it then. Patsy, my thoughts of you
have helped me out of many tight places.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d only be sensible, Basdel, and stay back
here where you belong. Just say the word and
father will place you in his office. I&#8217;m sure of it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>&#8220;So am I sure of it, if you asked it. No, Patsy,
it can&#8217;t be that way. I thank you. I may be an
awful failure, but I can always fool myself with
hoping for better things. If I was pushed into
trade, that would end me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you know your limitations better than
I do,&#8221; she coldly said. &#8220;Thanks for the pretty moccasins.
I may have a chance to wear them soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not wear them over the mountains,&#8221; I
begged. &#8220;You were never meant for the frontier.
Good-by.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had mounted my horse and was galloping back
to Richfield almost before I had realized how definitely
I had separated from her. There was so much
I had intended to say. My thoughts grew very bitter
as I repeatedly lived over our short and unsatisfactory
meeting. I recalled patches of the bright
dreams filling my poor noodle when I was riding
to meet her, and I smiled in derision at myself.</p>
<p>I had carried her in my heart for three years, and
because daily I had paid my devotion to her I had
been imbecile enough to imagine she was thinking
of me in some such persistent way. Patsy Dale was
admired by many men. Her days had been filled
with compliments and flattery.</p>
<p>My face burned as though a whip had been laid
across it when I recalled her frank skepticism of my
ability to support a wife. I had a rifle. Several
times she had thrust that ironical reminder at me,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
which meant I had nothing else. I came to her carrying
my rifle. It was unfair to tie a girl with a
promise when the wooer had only his rifle.</p>
<p>The damnable repetition kept crawling through
my mind. She wanted to impress the fact of my
poverty upon me. I worked up quite a fine bit of
anger against Patsy. I even told myself that had I
come back with profits derived from peddling rum
to the Indians, I might have found her more susceptible
to my approach. Altogether I made rather a
wicked game of viewing the poor girl in an unsavory
light.</p>
<p>With a final effort I declared half-aloud that she
was not worth a serious man&#8217;s devotion. And it got
me nowhere. For after all, the remembrance of her
as she stood there, with her slim white neck and the
mass of blue-black hair towering above the upturned
face, told me she must ever fill my thoughts.</p>
<p>I reached Richfield early in the evening. Governor
Dunmore had retired against an early start
for Williamsburg. It was Colonel Lewis&#8217; wish that
I ride without delay to Charles Lewis&#8217; place at
Staunton, something better than eighty miles, and
confer with him over the situation on the frontier.</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother has recently received intelligences
from Fort Pitt which state the Indians are anxious
for peace,&#8221; explained the colonel.</p>
<p>&#8220;A parcel of lies,&#8221; I promptly denounced.</p>
<p>&#8220;So say I. But the written statements are very
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
plausible. They have made an impression on
Charles. It is very important that he know the
truth. It will be much better for you to talk with
him than for me to try to send him your statements
in writing. Haste is necessary. Leave your horse
and take one of mine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have your man bring out the horse. I will start
now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A prompt response,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And most pleasing.
But to-morrow early will do. Spend the night
here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To-night. Now,&#8221; I insisted. &#8220;I need action.&#8221;</p>
<p>He gave me a sharp glance, then called his man
and gave the order. While my saddle was being
shifted he informed me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Ericus Dale and John Ward paid us a call. Dale
and His Excellency had a rare bout of words. The
fellow Ward didn&#8217;t say much, but he agreed to
everything Dale said.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know about the way Dale talked,&#8221; I gloomily
said. &#8220;I talked with him before he came here. He
thinks that Virginia is made up of fools, that only
Pennsylvania knows how to handle the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>I swung into the saddle and the colonel kindly
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope this business of mine isn&#8217;t taking you
away from something more pleasant.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I thank you, Colonel, but I am quite free. All
I ask is action and an early return to the frontier.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>I knew the colonel knew the truth. He knew I
had paid my respects to the girl and had been dismissed.
He stretched out a hand in silence and gave
me a hearty handshake; and I shook the reins and
thundered up the road to Staunton.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE PACK-HORSE-MAN&#8217;S MEDICINE</h3>
</div>

<p>Charles Lewis was as popular as he was
widely known. He had the gift of attracting
men to him on short acquaintance and of holding
them as life-long friends. His fame as an Indian-fighter
was known throughout the South, his adventures
possessing those picturesque elements
which strongly appeal to border-folk. During the
Braddock and Pontiac Wars his service was practically
continuous.</p>
<p>In his home-life he was a kindly, gentle man. I
found him playing with his five small children. He
greeted me warmly and displayed none of his brother&#8217;s
austerity. During the greater part of two days
which I was in his hospitable home I succeeded, I
pride myself, in showing him the truth concerning
the various reports sent over the line from Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I know that when I left him he was convinced the
war must be fought to a decisive finish before any
of our western valleys could be safe. On one point
he was very positive: the Cherokees, he insisted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
would not join the Ohio tribes, despite the murder of
Oconostota&#8217;s brother. Could the people of the
Clinch and Holston have felt the same confidence,
they would have spared themselves much nagging.</p>
<p>I took my time in returning to Salem, for there
was much to think over. The bulk of my meditations
concerned Patsy Dale. I decided to see her
once more before crossing the mountains. I had no
hope of finding her changed, but I did not intend to
leave a shadow of a doubt in my own mind. I
would leave no room for the torturing thought that
had I been less precipitate she would have been more
kindly.</p>
<p>Yet I had no foolish expectations; I knew Patricia.
This last interview was to be an orderly
settlement of the whole affair, and assurance that
self-accusation should not accompany me to the
wilderness. Then with the war over there would
be no over-mountain ties to hold me back from the
Kentucky country, or the Natchez lands.</p>
<p>I reached Richfield just as Colonel Lewis was
setting forth to settle some wrangling between two
of his captains. It was the old contention over
enlistments, each leader charging the other with
stealing men. I stopped only long enough to get
my horse and to induce the colonel to let me have
twenty pounds of powder and ten pounds of lead
for the settlers. The lead was sufficient for seven
hundred rounds and, divided into one-fourth portions,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
the powder would give a consciousness of
power of eighty riflemen.</p>
<p>It was late afternoon when my fresh mount
brought me to Salem, and without any hesitation&mdash;for
I must move while my resolve was high&mdash;I galloped
out to the Dale house. The low sun extended
my shadow to a grotesque length as I flung myself
from the saddle and with an attempt at a bold swagger
advanced to find the maid. I am sure my bearing
suggested confidence, but it was purely physical.</p>
<p>Inwardly I was quaking and wondering how I
should begin my explanation for this second call.
I was a most arrant coward when I mounted the
veranda. The carefully rehearsed calm of my
leather face vanished and I made the discouraging
discovery that my features were out of control. The
door of the house was open. I rapped loudly and
frowned. A shuffling step, which never could be
Patricia&#8217;s, nor yet heavy enough for Dale, finally
rewarded by efforts. A colored woman came to
the door and ducked her portly form.</p>
<p>I began asking for Patricia, but she recognized
me as a recent caller and broke in:</p>
<p>&#8220;De massa &#8217;n&#8217; de young missy done gwine &#8217;way.
Dat onery white man gone wif dem.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone away? John Ward went with them?&#8221; I
mumbled. &#8220;Which way did they ride, Aunty?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dat a-way.&#8221; And she pointed to the sun, now
sliced in half by Walker&#8217;s Mountain.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are sure they made for the mountains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Dey gwine to slam right ag&#8217;in&#8217; &#8217;em, den ride
ober dem,&#8221; she declared.</p>
<p>So after all my warnings the Dales were foolhardy
enough to ride into danger. Ericus Dale
would not only stake his own life but even his daughter&#8217;s
on his faith in red men. I recalled Cornstalk&#8217;s
pretended friendship for the whites at Carr&#8217;s Creek
and on Jackson&#8217;s River and the price the settlers
paid for their trustfulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;When did they ride?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Two days ergo. Bright &#8217;n&#8217; early in de mornin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran to my horse and mounted. As I yanked his
head about the servant called after me:</p>
<p>&#8220;De missy have dem mogasums wif her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The first stage of my journey was to Dunlap&#8217;s
Creek, although there was no certainty that the
Dales and Ward were taking that route. I had
small doubt, however, but that Dale was bound for
the home of his cousin on Howard&#8217;s Creek. Unless
he knew of some secret trace over the mountains he
would follow the open trail.</p>
<p>He would be more likely to go boldly and openly,
I reasoned, because of his belief there was nothing
for him to fear. His daughter&#8217;s convenience would
be better suited by the main traveled trails. As I
hurried to the west I paused at every habitation and
inquired for the travelers. Always the same reply;
two men and a woman had been observed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span></p>
<p>When I finally reached the Greenwood cabin at
Dunlap&#8217;s Creek I learned I had gained a day because
of Patricia&#8217;s need for rest. She was an odd bundle
of contradictions. She felt superior to frontier
women, and how they would have smiled at the
thought of recuperating after the easy travel from
Salem to the creek! Many of the women on the
Greenbriar had walked the entire distance over the
mountains so that the pack-animals might be used
in carrying the jealously guarded and pitiably few
household-goods.</p>
<p>It was amazing to contemplate what a difference
two or three hundred miles could make in one&#8217;s
environment. Patricia Dale, soft and dainty, was
used to the flattery of the town, and, I feared, the
attention of many beaux. Her parents had known
none of the comfortable places in life at her age;
and yet she had responded to her environment, had
been petted by it, and now she was a domestic kitten.
I wondered if she would respond to her ancestry
if placed among arduous experiences. I knew
the kitten would, and therein I found hope for Patsy
Dale.</p>
<p>I had been greatly shocked when told the girl was
being taken over the mountains. Now by some
peculiar mental twist I was beginning to enjoy
secretly the prospect of seeing her again and in surroundings
which harmonized with long rifles and
hunting-shirts. On the surface I persisted in my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
anger at Dale and vehemently wished her back at
Salem. Yet my guilty anticipation endured, and
as a sop to conscience I tried to make myself believe
there was no danger.</p>
<p>Howard&#8217;s Creek could not be conquered so long
as the settlers kept close to the cabins and fort. I
believed that or I should have urged a return of all
the women to the east side of the mountains. If
the enemy, in force, should lay a protracted siege,
Howard&#8217;s Creek would be remembered among other
bloody annals.</p>
<p>But I knew there would be no prolonged attempt
to massacre the settlement. Cornstalk was too wise
a warrior to weaken his forces for a score of scalps
when a general engagement was pending. Let him
win that and he could take his time in blotting out
every cabin west of the Alleghanies. So after all
it was neither difficult nor illogical to convince myself
the girl would be safe as long as she kept close
to the creek.</p>
<p>Even Dale would not plan to take his daughter
beyond the creek. If he attempted it there were
men enough to prevent the mad act. Across this
line of thought came the recollection of the Grisdols&#8217;
fate. The girl would be safe at Howard&#8217;s
Creek, but death lined the trace leading thereto. My
reason assured me Black Hoof&#8217;s band had long
since departed from the mountains.</p>
<p>My fear that the girl was being led into an ambush
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
threw me into a fine sweat; and I pushed on
the faster. I reviewed all the circumstances which
would preclude the possibility of an Indian attack
on the three travelers. There could be no Indians
between Dunlap&#8217;s and Howard&#8217;s. Black Hoof&#8217;s
losses at the Grisdol cabin, the venomous hatred of
young Cousin stalking them day and night and
the appearance of Baby Kirst would surely hasten
their retreat.</p>
<p>But there would obtrude the terrible possibility of
a few raiders hiding along the trace, determined to
strengthen their medicine with more white scalps.
But never once did I count in favor of the girl Dale&#8217;s
boasted friendship with the Shawnees. Even my
most visionary listing of assets could not include
that. I made a night-camp half-way across the
mountains and dined on cold provisions procured
from the Greenwoods.</p>
<p>The morning brought optimism. By this time
the girl was safe in the Davis cabin. I finished
my prepared food and resumed my journey. I had
covered a mile when a mounted figure turning a
twist in the trace ahead sent me to the ground. The
two of us struck the ground at about the same moment.
Our rifles slid across the saddles as if we
were puppets worked by the same string. Then a
voice called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t shoot if you won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course he was white.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jesse Hughes!&#8221; I exclaimed, vaulting into the
saddle. &#8220;These are queer hunting-grounds for
you.&#8221; Then in sudden terror, &#8220;Are the Indians
back here in the mountains?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil take worse luck! No,&#8221; he grumbled as he
trotted to meet me. &#8220;I&#8217;m going out to Greenwood&#8217;s
to see if I can&#8217;t git a few shoots of powder.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Ericus Dale, the trader?&#8221; I
anxiously asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I seen the fool. He was making the creek
when I come off. His gal was with him and John
Ward. Come pretty nigh potting that Ward feller.
He&#8217;s a white man, but I can&#8217;t git it out of my noodle
that he ain&#8217;t a&#8217; Injun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How did Dale&#8217;s girl stand the journey?&#8221;</p>
<p>The query surprised him, and he looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand it?&#8221; he slowly repeated. &#8220;Why, she ain&#8217;t
sick or hurt, is she?&#8221;</p>
<p>I said something about her not being used to riding
long distances.</p>
<p>&#8220;Long distances!&#8221; he snorted. &#8220;Wal, if a woman
can&#8217;t foller a smooth trace on a good hoss for a
day&#8217;s ride, she ain&#8217;t got no business west of the
mountains. I can&#8217;t stick here swapping talk. I&#8217;ve
got to push on and git that powder. Curse the luck!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Greenwoods have no powder to spare. He
has less than half a pound.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Black devils in a pipe! Howard&#8217;s Creek will
have to go to making bows and arrers!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve brought twenty pounds of powder and ten
of lead from Salem,&#8221; I added. &#8220;Howard&#8217;s Creek
is welcome to it after I&#8217;ve outfitted myself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hooray! That ends that cussed trip. Twenty
pounds! Wal, I declare if there won&#8217;t be some rare
killings! Now I&#8217;ll hustle right back along with
you. I&#8217;ve felt all the time that some one would be
gitting hair that belonged to me if I come off the
creek. Ten pounds of lead! Seven hundred little
pills! That&#8217;ll let Runner, Hacker, Scott &#8217;n&#8217; me
strike for the Ohio, where we can catch some of
them red devils as they beat back home. They&#8217;ll
be keerless and we oughter nail quite a few.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Crabtree isn&#8217;t going with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ike ain&#8217;t got no stummick for a reg&#8217;lar stand-up
fight. He&#8217;ll hang round the creek and kill when he
catches a red along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll get no powder from my stock to use around
the creek,&#8221; I declared.</p>
<p>Hughes eyed me moodily.</p>
<p>&#8220;What odds where they&#8217;re killed so long as
they&#8217;re rubbed out?&#8221; he harshly demanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Women and children are the odds,&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;Crabtree kills friendly Indians. Even young
Cousin, who hates reds as much as any man alive,
won&#8217;t make a kill in a settlement unless the Indians
are attacking it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the one weak spot in Cousin,&#8221; regretted
Hughes. &#8220;He&#8217;s a good hater. But he&#8217;d have a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
bigger count for that little sister of his if he&#8217;d take
them wherever he finds them. It&#8217;s all damn foolishness
to pick and choose your spot for killing a
red skunk. And this friendly Injun talk makes me
sick! Never was a time but what half the Shawnees
and other tribes was loafing &#8217;round the settlements,
pretending to be friends, while t&#8217;other half
was using the tomahawk and scalping-knife.</p>
<p>&#8220;That sort of medicine won&#8217;t do for me. No,
siree! Injuns are a pest, just like wolves and
painters, only worse. They must be wiped out.
That&#8217;s my belief and I make it my business to wipe
them out. Few men that&#8217;s got more&#8217;n me.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a waste of time to talk with a bloody-minded
man. Hughes&#8217; brother was killed by the Indians.
As for that, there was hardly a settler in Virginia
who had not lost some dear friend or relative.
When the history of the country is written, it will
surprise the coming generations to read the many
names having opposite them, &#8220;Killed by the Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was sorry I had met Hughes. His company
grated on me. It was impossible to think of Patsy
Dale with the fellow&#8217;s cruel babble ringing in my
ears. I remained silent and he garrulously recounted
some of his many exploits, and with gusto
described how he had trapped various victims. It
was his one ambition of life. He cared nothing for
land.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span></p>
<p>Offer him all of Colonel Washington&#8217;s thirty-odd
thousand acres on the Ohio and Great Kanawha as
a gift, and he would have none of them unless they
contained red men to slaughter. He had laid down
a red path and it was his destiny to follow it. I
had no love for Shawnee or Mingo, but my mind
held room for something besides schemes for bloodletting.</p>
<p>And yet it was well for me that I had met Hughes
the Indian-hater, and doubly well that I had brought
powder and lead so that he had turned back with
me. We were riding down the western slope and
about clear of the mountains, I trying to think my
own thoughts and he talking, talking, his words
dripping blood, when ahead in the trace I spied
something on the ground that caused me to exclaim
aloud.</p>
<p>It was a brightly beaded moccasin, very small,
and strangely familiar even at a distance. Hughes
saw it and stared at it through half-closed lids. I
leaped from my horse and started forward to pick
it up.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t touch it;&#8221; yelled Hughes. &#8220;Come back!
Come back!&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard him and understood his words, and yet
I continued advancing while I mechanically endeavored
to guess his reason for stopping me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jump, you fool!&#8221; he yelled as I stretched out
my hand to pick up the moccasin. And his horse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
was almost upon me and covering me with dirt as
he pivoted and slid into the bushes, his hindquarters
hitting me and hurling me over, half a dozen
feet beyond the little moccasin. I landed on my
head and shoulders with the crack of a rifle echoing
in my dazed ears.</p>
<p>Instinct sent me rolling out of the trace and into
the bushes. By the time I gained my knees and
had cleared the dirt from my eyes Hughes was working
rapidly up the right-hand slope. His horse stood
at the edge of the bushes, rubbing noses with my
animal. I kept under cover of the growth and
halted abreast of the moccasin.</p>
<p>There was a furrow within a few inches of its
embroided toe. I broke a branch and pawed the
moccasin toward me and picked it up and went
back to the horses. Then I took time to examine
my prize. It was one of the pair I had given to
Patsy Dale. She must have carried it carelessly to
drop it in the trace without discovering her loss. I
slipped it into my hunting-shirt and sat down to
wait for Hughes. It was fully an hour before he
came back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t git a crack at him,&#8221; he growled, his
face grim and sullen. &#8220;But you was a fool to be
took in by such a clumsy trick as that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an old trick,&#8221; I conceded, taking the moccasin
from my shirt. &#8220;If it had been any Indian
finery I would have kept clear of it. But this happens
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span>
to belong to Ericus Dale&#8217;s girl. She dropped
it coming down the slope.&#8221;</p>
<p>He heard this in astonishment and scratched his
head helplessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then I must &#8217;a&#8217; been asleep, or in a hell of a
hurry when I come to this slope,&#8221; he muttered.
&#8220;And it ain&#8217;t just the right kind of a slope to go
galloping over. I don&#8217;t understand it a bit. They
was riding into the settlement when I come out. I
called to Dale and asked if he&#8217;d seen any Injun signs.
He told me he hadn&#8217;t seen any. Then that feller
Ward come trotting out the woods, looking like a&#8217;
Injun, and I was bringing up my rifle to give him
his needings when Dale let out a yelp and said he
was a white man. Wal, it&#8217;ll tickle the gal to learn
how near her moccasin come to killing you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Indian knew it was there and knew we
were coming, and used it for bait,&#8221; I mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;A five-year-old child would know that,&#8221; was
the scornful rejoinder. &#8220;But what no five-year-old
on Howard&#8217;s Creek would &#8217;a&#8217; done was to go for to
git it after I&#8217;d called a halt. You must &#8217;a&#8217; been
foolish in your mind. The Injun took a spot where
he could line his gun on the moccasin. The growth
cut off any sight of the trace &#8217;cept where the moccasin
lay. All he had to do was to line it and shoot
when you stooped over it. The second he couldn&#8217;t
see the moccasin he&#8217;d know some one&#8217;s body was
between it and him. He heard me bawl out, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
he didn&#8217;t git sight of you till you was over it, and
by that time my old hoss give you a belt and made
you keep on moving.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He undershot, yet as I was bending close to it
he would have bagged me,&#8221; I said. &#8220;I have to thank
you for saving my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Part of a day&#8217;s work,&#8221; he carelessly observed.
&#8220;Wal, seeing as the skunk has skedaddled, we might
as well push on rather smart and tell the fellers
there&#8217;s a loose red round these parts.&#8221;</p>
<p>When we entered the settlement we saw men and
women gathered in front of the Davis cabin, frankly
curious to see the newcomers and eager to volley
them with questions. I joined the group and
through a window beheld Patsy in animated conversation
with what women could crowd inside. Mrs.
Davis was very proud of her cousin&#8217;s daughter and
was preening herself considerably.</p>
<p>Patsy&#8217;s cheeks were flushed and her tongue was
racing as only a woman&#8217;s can. As she talked I could
see she was trying to get used to the table of split
slabs and its four round legs set in auger-holes, the
pewter tableware and the spoons and bowls fashioned
from wood, and the gourds and hard-shell
squash hollowed out for noggings.</p>
<p>With a slant of half-veiled eyes she also was
studying the women&#8217;s linsey petticoats and bare
feet, for now that it was warm weather many dispensed
with any foot-covering. In turn the women
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
were openly examining the texture and style of her
town gown, and shrilly calling on one another to
come and admire her soft leather boots.</p>
<p>I did not see Dale, and Davis informed me he was
inspecting the fort. As Ward was not in sight I
assumed he, too, was at the fort. Making my way
to the window, I caught Patsy&#8217;s eye and handed her
her lost moccasin.</p>
<p>She stared at the moccasin in bewilderment, but
what with the newness of her experience and the
voluble praise of the women and the open-eyed
admiration of the men, she was finely excited. She
forgot to ask where I found the moccasin or how I
happened to be there. She was in the act of giving
me a smile and a nod when Mrs. Davis tugged her
to the right-about.</p>
<p>Realizing it was useless to strive for the girl&#8217;s
attention until the neighbors returned to their cabins,
I walked to the fort, leading my horse. Hughes
was there ahead of me and stood with a group of
sullen-faced men who were being addressed by
Ericus Dale.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say there ain&#8217;t going to be any war,&#8221; he cried
as I took a position behind him. &#8220;The Indians
don&#8217;t want war. They want trade. Take a pack of
goods on your horse and walk into a Shawnee village
and see how quick they&#8217;ll quit the war-post to
buy red paint and cloth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open a keg of New England rum among the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
Mingos and see how quick they&#8217;ll drop their axes
and hunt for tin dippers. Take blankets and beads
to the Wyandots and watch them hang up white
wampum. Take&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all fool talk!&#8221; thundered Hughes
crowding forward and staring angrily into the
trader&#8217;s deep-set eyes. &#8220;You can&#8217;t lead a pack-hoss
fifty miles from this creek without losing your hair,
neighbor.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can! I will!&#8221; wrathfully replied Dale. &#8220;I&#8217;ve
traded for years with the Indians. I never yet
went to them with a gun in my hand. If ever I
need protection, they&#8217;ll protect me. They are my
friends. This war is all wrong. You can have it
if you insist. But if you&#8217;d rather have trade, then
you needn&#8217;t build any more forts west of the Alleghanies.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hughes laughed hoarsely and called out to the
silent settlers:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you fellers say to all this twaddle?
Any of you believe it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Dick, whom I had left whetting his knife
on the stones of the Davis fireplace, gave a cackling
laugh and answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Believe it? No! But it&#8217;s fun to hear him
splutter.&#8221;</p>
<p>The men smiled grimly. They had held back
from affronting their neighbor&#8217;s cousin. They
looked upon Dale much as they looked on Baby
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
Kirst when he came to the settlement and whimpered
because he could not find ripe berries to pick.
They were deciding that Dale was mentally irresponsible;
only his malady took a different twist
than did Baby&#8217;s. He was an Indian-lover instead
of hater. Dale&#8217;s dark face flushed purple with
anger. By an effort he controlled himself and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. You men want a fight. I&#8217;m afraid
you&#8217;ll have it. But I tell you that if Dunmore
would call off that dog of a Connolly at Fort Pitt
I could go among the Ohio Indians and make a
peace which would last.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How about the Injuns being willing for us to
go down into the Kentucky country?&#8221; spoke up
Moulton.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you want peace with the Indian, you must let
him keep a place to hunt and live in. He can&#8217;t live
if you take away his hunting-grounds.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s take &#8217;em away so they&#8217;ll die out tarnation
fast,&#8221; cried Elijah Runner.</p>
<p>Drawing himself up and speaking with much
dignity, Dale said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sorry for any of you men who came out
here to make homes if you will let a few Indian-killers,
who never make homes, spoil your chances
for getting ahead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t go for to kill every Injun we see,&#8221; said
Davis, heretofore silent. &#8220;I&#8217;m a fambly-man. I
don&#8217;t want Injuns butchered here in the settlement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
like as Ike Crabtree done for Cherokee Billy. No
sense in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I say, too,&#8221; agreed another. And
this endorsement of Davis&#8217; view became quite general.
Of course I had known right along that the
settlers as a whole did not look with favor upon
indiscriminate slaughter of the natives. Dale
nodded his approval and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s something. Only you don&#8217;t go far
enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hughes angrily took up the talk, declaring:</p>
<p>&#8220;You cabin-men are mighty tickled to have us
Injun-hating fellers come along when there&#8217;s any
chance of trouble. I&#8217;ve noticed that right along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Course we are, Jesse,&#8221; agreed Davis. &#8220;But
that don&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re mighty glad when some of
you kill a friendly Injun in the settlement and, by
doing so, bring the fighting to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low we&#8217;ve outstayed our welcome,&#8221; Hughes
grimly continued. &#8220;You folks foller this man&#8217;s
trail and it&#8217;ll lead you all to the stake. I&#8217;m moving
on to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go away mad, Jesse,&#8221; piped up old Uncle
Dick. &#8220;Talk don&#8217;t hurt nothin&#8217;. Stick along an&#8217;
git your fingers into the fightin&#8217; what&#8217;s bound to
come.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going away to kill Injuns,&#8221; was the calm
reply. &#8220;That&#8217;s my business.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hacker, Scott &#8217;n&#8217; me will go along with you,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
said Runner. &#8220;Now that Howard&#8217;s Creek has got
a trader to keep the Injuns off, we ain&#8217;t needed here
no more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I can keep the Indians away,&#8221; cried Dale.
&#8220;When I offer them my belts, they&#8217;ll be glad to
receive them. You send them a few trade-belts in
place of the bloody ax and they&#8217;ll be your friends,
too.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; roared Hughes, too disgusted to talk.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the white Injun say?&#8221; yelled one of
the young men.</p>
<p>He had barely put the query before John Ward
stalked through the fort door and stood at Dale&#8217;s
elbow. Speaking slowly and stressing his words
in that jerky fashion that marks an Indian&#8217;s speech
in English, he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The trader is right. I have been a prisoner
among Indians for many years. I know their
minds. Dale can go anywhere among Indians where
he has been before, and no hand will be lifted
against him.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a liar!&#8221; passionately cried Hughes, his
hand creeping to his belt.</p>
<p>Ward folded his arms across his deep chest and
stared in silence at Hughes for nearly a minute;
then slowly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;No Indian ever called me that. It&#8217;s a man of
my own race that uses the word to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And a mighty cheap sample of his race,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
boomed Dale, his heavy face convulsed with rage.
&#8220;A cheap killer, who must strike from behind!
Faugh! It&#8217;s creatures like you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; With an
animal screech Hughes jumped for him. Before
we could seize the infuriated man Ward&#8217;s arm was
thrust across his chest and with the rigidity of a
bar of iron stopped the assault. Before Hughes
could pull knife or ax from his belt we hustled him
into the background. His three friends scowled
ferociously but offered no interference. It was
obvious that the settlers as a body would not tolerate
any attack on Dale.</p>
<p>Inarticulate with rage, Hughes beckoned for
Hacker, Scott and Runner to follow him. A few
rods away he halted and called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;Dale, I&#8217;ll live to hear how your red friends have
danced your scalp. Then I&#8217;ll go out and shoot some
of them. That white Injun beside you will be one
of the first to stick burning splinters into your
carcass. He&#8217;s lived with redskins too long to forget
his red tricks. Come on, fellers.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sorry disturbance depressed the spirits of
the settlers. War was on, and there was none of
the Howard&#8217;s Creek men who believed that any
change in their attitude could prevent the Ohio Indians
from slaying at every opportunity. No matter
how much they might decry the acts of Hughes
and his mates in time of peace, there was no denying
the fighting-value of the quartet when it came
to war.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span></p>
<p>No word was spoken until the last of the four
killers had filed away to secure their horses and be
gone. Then Davis said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Time to eat, Ericus. Let&#8217;s go back and see how
the women-folks is gettin&#8217; along.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep that white scum from this creek until I
can carry a bag of talk to Cornstalk and Logan and
you won&#8217;t need any armed bullies to protect you,&#8221;
said Dale.</p>
<p>&#8220;We ain&#8217;t askin&#8217; of &#8217;em to look after us, nor you
with your white belts, neither,&#8221; shrilly proclaimed
Uncle Dick.</p>
<p>Some of the younger men laughed.</p>
<p>Dale reddened, but turned to walk with his cousin
without making any answer. He all but bumped
into me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Morris!&#8221; he greeted, staring at me in
surprise. &#8220;You bob up everywhere. Will you go
with me to the Scioto villages?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as what?&#8221; I cautiously asked. The men
gathered closer about us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go as a trader, carrying white wampum. Go
to make peace with the Shawnees,&#8221; slowly replied
Dale, his eyes burning with the fire of fanaticism.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not hankering for slow fires, nor to have squaws
heap coals on my head, I must refuse,&#8221; I retorted.
&#8220;But I&#8217;ll go with you or any man, as a scout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In your blood, too,&#8221; he jeered. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t suppose
you&#8217;d been out here long enough to lose your
head.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d certainly lose it if the Shawnees got me,&#8221; I
good-naturedly retorted. My poor jest brought a
rumble of laughter from the men and added to
Dale&#8217;s resentment, which I greatly regretted.</p>
<p>John Ward glided to my side and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You talk like a child. I have been long among
the Indians. They did not take my head.&#8221;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t like the fellow. There was something
of the snake in his way of stealthily approaching.
I could not get it out of my head that he must
be half-red. Had he been all Indian, I might have
found something in him to fancy; for there were
red men whom I had liked and had respected immensely.
But Ward impressed me as being neither
white nor red. He stirred my bile. Without thinking
much, I shot back at him:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps they did something worse to you than
to take your head. Are you sure they didn&#8217;t take
your heart?&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned on his heel and stalked away. Dale
snarled:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re worse than Hughes and those other fools.
You even hate a poor white man who has been held
prisoner by the Indians. He comes back to his
people and you welcome him by telling him he&#8217;s a
renegade. Shame on you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No call for that sort of talk to Ward at all!&#8221;
denounced Davis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What call had Ward to say he was a fool?&#8221;
loudly demanded one of the young men.</p>
<p>&#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t have said that,&#8221; I admitted, now
much ashamed of my hot-headedness. &#8220;I&#8217;ll say as
much to Ward when I see him next. If he&#8217;d look
and act more like a white man then I&#8217;d keep remembering
that he is white. But I shouldn&#8217;t have said
that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Morris, that&#8217;s much better,&#8221; said Dale. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
him what you said and you needn&#8217;t eat your words
a second time in public. I admire you for conquering
yourself and saying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Uncle Dick did not relish my retraction, and his
near-sighted eyes glared at me in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Too much talkin&#8217;. Scouts oughter be out. Our
friends, th&#8217; killers, have quit us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glad to be alone, I volunteered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll scout half the circle, striking west, then
south, returning on the east side.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moulton, a quiet, soft-spoken fellow, but a very
demon in a fight, picked up his rifle and waved his
hand to his wife and little girl and trotted in the
opposite direction, calling back over his shoulder:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go east, north and half-down the west side.&#8221;</p>
<p>I finished on the north leg at the point where
Moulton had commenced his scout. I made no discoveries
while out. I walked to the fort and was
glad to see that Moulton had but recently come in.
I returned to the Davis cabin and passed behind
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
it. So far as I could observe no sentinels had been
posted on the east side of the clearing. In front of
the cabin burned a big fire and there was a confusion
of voices.</p>
<p>I gained a position at the end of the cabin, and
from the shadows viewed the scene. It was old
to me, but new to Patsy, and she was deeply interested.
The young men had erected a war-post, and
had painted the upper half red. Now they were
dancing and cavorting around the post like so many
red heathens, bowing their heads nearly to the
ground and then throwing them far back. They
were stripped to the waist and had painted their
faces, and as they danced they stuck their axes into
the post and whooped and howled according to the
Indian ceremony of declaring war.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it!&#8221; I heard Dale protest.</p>
<p>&#8220;But the boys only wanted Patsy to see how the
Injuns git ready for war,&#8221; defended Mrs. Davis.
&#8220;An&#8217;, lor&#8217;! Ain&#8217;t she all took up by it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s the way the border men declared war
after the murder at Yellow Creek,&#8221; declared Dale.
&#8220;They stripped and painted and struck the post and
danced around it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be through mighty soon now, Ericus,&#8221;
soothed Davis, who was uneasy between his fears
of displeasing his wife&#8217;s cousin and giving offense
to the young men. &#8220;They meant well.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span></p>
<p>&#8220;All such actions mean ill for the settlers,&#8221;
growled Dale. &#8220;They&#8217;d best finish at once.&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis did not have to incur his neighbors&#8217; ill-will
by asking the dancers to cease their ceremony, as
Dale&#8217;s speech was closely followed by a volley from
the west side of the clearing. A dancer went down,
coughing and clawing at his throat, while yelps of
surprise and pain told me others had been wounded.
I raised my rifle and fired toward the flashes.</p>
<p>With the promptness of seasoned veterans the
young men kicked the fire to pieces and grabbed up
their rifles and advanced toward the hidden foe,
their movements being barely perceptible even while
within reach of the light streaming from the cabins.</p>
<p>It was not until I had fired and was reloading
that I was conscious of Patsy&#8217;s ear-splitting shrieks.
I heard her father fiercely command her to be still,
then command Davis to recall the young men now
lost in the darkness. A stentorian voice began
shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;All women to the fort! Put out all lights!&#8221;</p>
<p>One by one the candles were extinguished. Patsy
was silent, and across the clearing came the low
voices of the women, driving their children before
them and urging them to hurry. Dark forms were
discernible close at hand and were those settlers
apportioned to defend the fort.</p>
<p>Davis was commanding his wife to take Patsy
to the fort while there was yet time, and she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
refusing. The savages must have heard the men
and women leaving the outlying cabins, for they
started to rush from the woods only to fall back
before a brisk volley from the young men now
scouting well to the front.</p>
<p>I walked to the cabin door just as the war-whoop
of the Shawnees announced an attack in force. I
was standing by Patsy&#8217;s side, but she did not see me.
She had both hands clapped over her ears, her lips
parted but uttering no sound. Now there came a
rush of feet and the young men fell back, some making
into the fort, others, as previously assigned, entering
the cabins close to the fort. Three came to
the Davis cabin, and I entered with them, leading
Patsy. Some one, I think it was Davis, dragged
Dale inside.</p>
<p>The trader seemed to be paralyzed, for he had
remained voiceless during the stirring events. And
it had all been a matter of a few minutes. I
jumped through the doorway just as a young man
began closing it. The Shawnees were yelling like
demons and approaching to close range very cautiously,
feeling out each rod of the ground.</p>
<p>The sally of the young men had taught them they
could not have all things their own way. I scouted
toward the fort to make sure all the women and
children had made cover, but before I could reach
the log walls I heard Dale&#8217;s voice shouting for attention.
I dropped behind a stump, and as the savages
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
ceased their howling I heard him hoarsely
crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the Pack-Horse-Man speaking. Do the
Shawnees fire guns at the Pack-Horse-Man? My
friends live here. Do the Shawnees hurt the friends
of the Pack-Horse-Man? I give you a belt to wash
the red paint from your faces. I give you a belt to
make the road smooth between the Greenbriar and
the Scioto. By this belt the nettles and rocks shall
be removed from the road. I will cover the bones of
your dead, if any fell to-night, with many presents.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was either very brave or crazy. For now he
left the cabin and began walking toward the hidden
Shawnees, his confident voice repeating the fact he
was the red man&#8217;s friend, that he brought white
belts, that the red and white men should eat from
one dish, and that a hole should be dug to the middle
of the earth and the war-ax buried there and a
mighty river turned from its ancient bed to flow
over the spot so that the ax could never be found.</p>
<p>His amazing boldness brought the hush of death
over cabins and forts. My horse, secured in the
small stockaded paddock near the fort, whinnied for
me to come to him, and his call in that tense stillness
set my nerves to jumping madly. Dale was now
close to the warriors. Every minute I expected to
see a streak of fire, or hear the crunch of an ax.
Trailing my rifle and bent double, I stole after him.
From the forest a deep voice shouted:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The belts of the Pack-Horse-Man are good belts.
Black Hoof&#8217;s warriors do not harm the friends of
the Pack-Horse-Man. Sleep with your cabin doors
open to-night and you shall hear nothing but the call
of the night birds and the voice of the little owl
talking with the dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>I now discovered that the Shawnees had silently
retreated to the woods at the beginning of Dale&#8217;s
advance. The declaration of peace as given by the
Indian&mdash;and I was convinced it was the famous
Black Hoof talking&mdash;was in the Shawnee tongue.
Dale faced to the cabins and fort and triumphantly
interpreted it. From deep in the forest came a pulsating
cry, the farewell of the marauders, as they
swiftly fell back toward New River. I was suspicious
of some Indian trick and yelled a warning for
the men to keep in the cabins.</p>
<p>Dale became very angry, and upbraided me:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the like of you that spoils the Indian&#8217;s heart.
You men have heard what the Black Hoof says.
You men and women of Howard&#8217;s Creek are foolish
to believe this young fool&#8217;s words. The Shawnees
have gone. You heard their travel-cry. They have
left none behind to harm by treachery. I told you
I could keep the Indians from attacking this settlement.
Could your friends, the killers, have sent
them away so quickly? I think not. Open your
doors. Light your candles. Make merry if you
will. There is nothing in the forest to harm you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Keep inside till I and some of the young men
have scouted the woods. Three men from the fort
will be enough,&#8221; I loudly shouted.</p>
<p>Dale was furious, but that was nothing when the
women and children had to be remembered. Soon
a soft pattering of moccasins, and three youths
stood before me. Choosing one, I set off in the
direction the Indians apparently had taken. The
other two were to separate, one scouting south and
the other north, to discover any attempt at a surprise
attack by swinging back to the creek in a half-circle.</p>
<p>My companion and I, although hampered by the
darkness, penetrated some miles toward New River.
In returning, we separated, one swinging south and
the other north. The first morning light was burning
the mists from the creek when I reentered the
clearing. My companion came in an hour later.
The other two had returned much earlier, having
had a much shorter course to cover. We all made
the same report; no signs of Indians except those
left by them in their retreat.</p>
<p>I sat outside the Davis cabin and Patsy brought
me some food. She was very proud of her father
and carried her small figure right grandly. Her
attitude toward the women was that of a protector;
and they, dear souls, so thankful to be alive, so eager
to accept the new faith, fairly worshiped the girl.</p>
<p>The one exception was the Widow McCabe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
She paid homage to no one. And while she said
nothing to the chorus of admiring exclamations
directed at the trader there was the same cold glint
in the slate-gray eyes, and she walked about with her
skirts tucked up and an ax in her hand.</p>
<p>I made no effort to talk with Patsy. Her frame
of mind was too exalted for speech with a skeptical
worm. She smiled kindly on me, much as a goddess
designs to sweeten the life of a mortal with a
glance. She smiled in gentle rebuke as she noted
my torn and stained garments and the moccasins
so sadly in need of patching.</p>
<p>&#8220;You silly boy! It wasn&#8217;t necessary. When will
you learn, Morris?&#8221; It was not intended that I
should answer this, for she turned away graciously
to receive the blessings of the women. Thus, vicariously,
was Ericus Dale recognized as a great man.
And the trader walked among the morning clouds.
For some hours the savor of his triumph stifled
speech, and he wandered about while the women paid
their tribute through his daughter.</p>
<p>Nor were the men lacking in appreciation. The
younger generation remained silent, secretly wishing
their bravery and marksmanship had scattered
the foe, yet unable to deny that Dale&#8217;s medicine had
been very powerful. Those with families stared
upon him as they might gaze on one who had looked
on David.</p>
<p>They congregated around the Davis cabin after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
the morning meal and forgot there was much work
to be done. They were eager to renew their fires
of this new faith by listening to him. And after his
exaltation had softened enough to permit of speech
the trader once more harangued them on his influence
over the natives. He was constantly in motion,
his swinging arms keeping a path clear as he strode
through the group and back again and addressed
the mountains and horizon. He was too full of
the sweets of a peaceful victory to confine his utterance
to any individual, and he spoke to the whole
frontier.</p>
<p>He concluded a long and eloquent speech by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;So after all, as you settlers have learned, the
Ohio tribes, yes, and all tribes, will always hark to
the one word&mdash;trade. They are now dependent
upon the white man for traps and guns, even their
women&#8217;s clothing. Trade with them and they will
remain your friends, for your goods they must have.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can plant your war-posts three feet apart
along the whole length of Virginia, and you&#8217;ll
always have work for your rifles and axes until the
last Indian-hunter is killed. I admit they can be
exterminated, but you&#8217;ll pay an awful price in doing
it. But give them a chance to live, carry trade-belts
to them, and you shall have peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Uncle Dick, the aged one, had nothing to
say. But it was Patsy I was watching while Dale
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
talked. She never took her eyes from him, and her
gaze was idolatrous in its love. She believed in his
powers implicitly; and to bask in the reflection of
his greatness was the sweetest triumph she had ever
experienced. Throughout that day the scouts were
busy in the forest, ranging very far on the track of
Black Hoof&#8217;s band. When they began dropping in
after sundown all their reports were alike.</p>
<p>There were no Indian-signs besides those left by
the departing Shawnee band. This band, said the
scouts, was very large and quite sufficient to cause
the settlement much trouble and inevitable losses.
There was no mistaking the story told by the trail.
The Indians had marched rapidly, swinging north.</p>
<p>Every emotion, unless it be that of love, must
have its ebb; and by nightfall the settlers were
returning to their old caution. Dale did not relish
this outcropping of old habits. Throwing open the
door of the Davis cabin after Davis had closed and
barred it, he cried: &#8220;Let us have air. There is no
danger. You&#8217;re like silly children afraid of the
dark. Your scouts have told you there are no Indians
near. Yet the minute the sun sets you imagine
the woods are full of them. I will go out alone and
unarmed and I will shout my name. If any Shawnee
who was not in Black Hoof&#8217;s band hears my
voice he will come to me. After he learns I have
friends here on Howard&#8217;s Creek, he will go away.
Give me time to act before that scoundrel Connolly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
can stir up more trouble and I&#8217;ll make a lasting
peace between the Greenbriar, the Clinch and the
Holston and the Ohio tribes; and I&#8217;ll make Dunmore
look like a fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>His overpowering personality, his massive way
of asserting things made a deep impression on the
simple folks. They asked only for a chance to
plant and reap. When he went out alone that night
he brought them deep under his spell. As he
plunged into the forest and stumbled about he took
pains to advertise his presence. Unknown to the
settlers, I trailed him. I was within ten feet of
him when he halted and shouted his name, and in
their language called on the Shawnees to come to
him.</p>
<p>For half an hour he wandered about, proclaiming
he was the Pack-Horse-Man, the ancient friend of
the Shawnees and Mingos. Let him be a fool
according to Jesse Hughes&#8217; notion, yet he was a
very brave man. He had the courage to attempt
proof of his belief in the honesty of the Shawnees.</p>
<p>I trailed him back to the cabin door. I saw the
girl&#8217;s radiant face as she proudly threw her arms
about his neck. I saw the great pride in his own
face as he stood in the middle of the floor and
harshly demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, who will you believe; Dale, the trader, or
Hughes, the killer?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was all mighty dramatic, and it was not surprising
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
that it should affect the settlers keenly. It
shook my skepticism a bit, but only for the moment.
If I could not feel a full confidence in John Ward,
born white, how could I place a deep and abiding
trust in those who were born red? Had not Cornstalk
and other chiefs, the best of their breed, sworn
friendship to the whites in Virginia in 1759 and
during Pontiac&#8217;s War? Had they not feasted with
old friends, and then, catching them off their guard,
chopped them down? Black Hoof had drawn off
his raiders; so far, so good. But I looked to my
flints none the less carefully that night and made the
rounds to see that reliable men were on guard. The
night passed with nothing to disturb the settlement&#8217;s
rest.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>LOST SISTER</h3>
</div>

<p>Patsy stood in the doorway of the Davis cabin
when I approached to pay my respects. She
was wearing a linsey petticoat and a short gown for
an overskirt. Her mass of wonderful hair was
partly confined by a calico cap, and on her feet
were my gift moccasins. She believed she was conforming
to the frontier standard of dress, but she
was as much out of place as a butterfly at a bear-baiting.
Before I could speak she was advancing
toward me, her hands on her hips, her head tilted
back, and demanding:</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you say now about the influence of
trade and the trader?&#8221;</p>
<p>She did not ask that she might learn my opinion;
she firmly believed there was but one thing I could
say. She was in an exultant mood and happy to
parade her triumph. Of course she was proud of
her father and was viewing him as the deliverer of
the settlement. Without waiting for me to answer
she excitedly continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;And your long rifle! And the rifles of all these
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
other men! What good would they have done?
They spoke night before last, and the Indians kept
up their attack. Then my father spoke and the Indians
have gone! John Ward, who was out scouting
when the Indians attacked, says they greatly
outnumbered us and were led by Black Hoof, one
of their greatest chiefs. He says they would have
captured or killed us if not for my father. Now,
Mr. Rifleman, what do you think about the influence
of an honest trader?&#8221;</p>
<p>I would not have shaken her pride in her father
even had that accomplishment been possible. To
convince her&mdash;which was not possible&mdash;that her
father&#8217;s success was no success at all, that Black
Hoof&#8217;s behavior was simply an Indian trick to lull
us into a foolish sense of security, would mean to
alienate even her friendship, let alone killing all
chance of her ever reciprocating my love.</p>
<p>While not deeply experienced with women, my
instinct early taught me that my sex is most unwise
in proving to a woman that she is wrong. She will
hold such procedure to be the man&#8217;s greatest fault.
It is far better to let her discover her own errors,
and even then pretend you still cling to her first
reasoning, thereby permitting her to convince you
that she was wrong.</p>
<p>On the other hand there was, I sensed, a peril in
the situation, a peril to Howard&#8217;s Creek, that made
my seeming acquiescence in her opinion very distasteful
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
to me. I had no proof of my suspicions
except my knowledge of Indian nature and my familiarity
with frontier history. A red man can be
capable of great and lasting friendships. But to
judge him, when he is at war, by the standards of
the white race is worse than foolish.</p>
<p>Cornstalk, according to his blood, was a great
man. Under certain conditions I would trust him
with my life as implicitly as I would trust any
white man. Under certain conditions I would
repose this same trust in him although he was at
war with my race. But when placed among the
combatants opposing him, I knew there was no subterfuge
even that great warrior would not use to
attain success.</p>
<p>So I said nothing of my doubts, nothing of my
vague suspicions concerning John Ward. I felt a
strong antipathy toward the fellow, and I realized
this dislike might prejudice me to a degree not warranted
by the facts. To put it mildly, his status
puzzled me. If he were an escaped prisoner then he
had committed one of the gravest sins in the red
man&#8217;s entire category.</p>
<p>To be taken into the tribe, to be adopted after his
white blood had been washed out by solemn ceremony,
and then to run away, meant the stake and
horrible preliminary tortures should he be recaptured.
As a prize such a runaway would be more
eagerly sought than any settler. And yet the fellow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
was back on the fringe of imminent danger and
ranging the woods unconcernedly. His captivity
must have taught him that every war-party would
be instructed to bring him in alive if possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Basdel?&#8221; demanded
the girl sharply as she turned and walked by my
side toward the Davis cabin. &#8220;You act queer. Do
you begrudge giving my father his due? Aren&#8217;t
you thankful he was here to stop the attack?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If he were here alone, yes. But I am terribly
worried because you are here, Patsy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s doubting my father&#8217;s influence!&#8221; she
rebuked, her eyes lighting war-signals.</p>
<p>&#8220;When one has loved, one stops reasoning,&#8221; I
quickly defended. &#8220;I can not bear to see even a
shadow of a chance of harm come to you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was said very pretty,&#8221; she smiled, her gaze
all softness.</p>
<p>Then with calm pride she unfastened several
strings of white wampum from around her slender
waist and holding them up simply said:</p>
<p>&#8220;My father&#8217;s belts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the strings was a strip some seven or
eight rows in width and two hundred beads long.
It was pictographic and showed a man leading a
pack-horse along a white road to a wigwam. The
figures, like the road, were worked in white beads,
the background being dark for contrast.</p>
<p>Refastening them about her waist, she said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is no danger for me here so long as I
wear my father&#8217;s belts. There are none of the Ohio
Indians who would refuse to accept them and respect
them. When they see the Pack-Horse-Man walking
along the white road to their villages they will
lift that belt up very high.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When one sees you, there should be no need of
belts,&#8221; I ventured.</p>
<p>She smiled graciously and lightly patted my
fringed sleeve, and ignoring my fervid declaration,
she gently reminded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if I had no belts I am no better than any
of the other women on the creek. Don&#8217;t think for
a moment I would hide behind my father&#8217;s trade
wampum. The belts must protect all of us, or none
of us. But there is no more danger for me than
there is for them even if I threw the belts away.
Not so much; because I am Ericus Dale&#8217;s daughter.
Basdel, it makes me unhappy to fear that when we
leave here the danger may return to these people.
I carry my safety with me. I wish I could leave
it for them. I wish a general and lasting peace
could be made.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;God knows I wish the same,&#8221; I cried. &#8220;As for
being no better than these other women, I agree to
that.&#8221; And she became suddenly thoughtful. &#8220;In
judging from a Howard&#8217;s Creek standpoint you are
not so good in many ways. Rather, I should say,
not so valuable.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You measure a woman&#8217;s value as you do your
guns and horses,&#8221; she murmured.</p>
<p>Her calmness was rather ominous, and I feared
I had bungled. Yet my meaning should have been
transparent even to a child. To make sure she had
not misconstrued me I explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I mean, no matter how I appear
to measure you. In making a new country a woman
on the edge of things must have certain qualities
that the town woman does not possess, does not
need to possess. It&#8217;s because of these qualities that
the new country becomes possible as a place to live
in; then the town woman develops. Two hundred
miles east are conditions that resulted from the
rugged qualities of the first women on the first
frontier.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those first women helped to make it safe for
their children&#8217;s children. Now it&#8217;s behind the frontier
and women of your kind live there. In other
words&#8221;&mdash;I was growing a trifle desperate, for her
gaze, while persistent, was rather blank&mdash;&#8220;you don&#8217;t
fit in out here. I doubt if you know how to run
bullets or load a gun or throw an ax. I&#8217;m sure
you&#8217;d find it very disagreeable to go barefooted. It
isn&#8217;t your place. Your values shine when you are
back in town. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m sorry you&#8217;re here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t shot a rifle, but I could learn,&#8221; she
quietly remarked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe that,&#8221; I heartily agreed. &#8220;But could
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
you take an ax and stand between a drove of children
and what you believed to be a band of Indians
about to break from cover and begin their work of
killing? I saw the Widow McCabe do that. I saw
the little Moulton woman, armed with an ax, run to
meet the attack.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s hardly sensible to ask if I could have done
this or that. Who knows what I could have done?
I shall never have to deal with what is past. And
there was a time, I suppose, when all these women
were new to the frontier. At least I should be allowed
time to learn certain things before you apply
your measuring-rod, sir!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; I admitted. &#8220;I was rather unjust,
but the fact remains that just now you are out of
place and not used to this life and its dangers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel very cross at you. You pass over my
father&#8217;s great work for the settlement with scarcely
a word. You complain because I am here and look
different from Mrs. Davis. I can&#8217;t help my looks.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You are adorable. Already see the havoc
you&#8217;ve wrought among the unmarried men. Observe
how many times each finds an errand that
takes him by this cabin door. How slow they are to
scout the woods and seek signs. No; you can&#8217;t
help your looks, and it results there are few men
who can resist loving you. There&#8217;s not a youngster
in this settlement who&#8217;s not up to his neck in love
with you already. And there&#8217;s not one of them who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
does not realize that you would be the poorest mate
he could pick so long as he must live on the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad to hear just what you believe about
me,&#8221; she muttered. &#8220;But you&#8217;re bewildering. It
seems I&#8217;m a rare prize for any man and a most
uncomfortable burden.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, dash it all, Patsy! You understand that
what I&#8217;ve said applies to Howard&#8217;s Creek. If we
were standing two hundred miles due east I should
say directly the opposite.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course she understood my true meaning, and
of course in her heart she agreed with it. She was
town-bred and therefore was intended for the town.
Yet so strangely stubborn and eccentric is a woman&#8217;s
reasoning that she can feel resentment toward a
man because he has brains enough to comprehend
the same simple truth that she comprehends.</p>
<p>Had there been no danger from the Indians I
could have scored a bull&#8217;s-eye with her by baldly
declaring her to be the most valuable asset the frontier
ever had received; and she would have dimpled
and smiled and but faintly demurred, knowing I
was a rock-ribbed liar for asserting it, and yet liking
me the more for the ridiculous exaggeration. That is
one reason why it is more sensible and much more
satisfactory to quarrel with a man than a woman.</p>
<p>With the tenacity which her sex displays when
believing a male is trying to avoid some issue, she
coldly reminded:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Talk, talk, but not a word yet as to what my
father did two nights ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of the most splendid exhibitions of
faith and moral courage I ever witnessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her gaze grew kindly again and she halted and
stared up into my eyes, flushed with pleasure, and
waited to hear more encomiums.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never before saw one man rush out and confront
a war-party. Then his going out alone last
night and prowling about through the dark forest!
That was magnificent. Your father is one of the
bravest men I ever saw.&#8221;</p>
<p>She rubbed a pink finger against her nose and
tilted her head and weighed my words thoughtfully.
Obviously I had omitted something; for with a little
frown worrying her fair forehead she began:</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but there&#8217;s something else you haven&#8217;t
said. What about his influence over the Indians?
You thought him foolish to take me over the mountains.
You now admit you were foolish to think
that?&#8221;</p>
<p>She was waiting for me to complete my confessional.
If the element of danger had been absent
how gladly I would have lied to her! How quickly
I would have won her approval by proclaiming myself
the greatest dolt in Virginia and her father the
wisest man in the world! But to accede to everything
she said and believed would be an endorsement
of her presence on the creek. I had had no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
idea of ousting myself from her good graces when
I went to find her that morning. Now the test had
come, and her welfare was involved; to be true to
her as well as to myself I was forced to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;I still think it was most dangerous for you to
come here. I believe your father acted very unwisely,
no matter how much be believes in his influence
over the Indians. And I would thank God if
you were back in Williamsburg.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her hands dropped to her side. The smiling
eyes grew hard.</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on!&#8221; she curtly commanded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve damned myself in your opinion already.
Isn&#8217;t that enough? Don&#8217;t make me pay double for
being honest.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest?&#8221; she jeered. &#8220;You&#8217;ve deliberately
dodged my question. I asked you what you thought
of my father&#8217;s power with the Indians. You rant
about his wickedness in bringing me here. For the
last time I ask you to answer my question and finish
your list of my father&#8217;s faults.&#8221;</p>
<p>As if to make more steep the precipice down which
from her esteem I was about to plunge there came
the voice of her father, loudly addressing the settlers.</p>
<p>&#8220;You people ought to wake up,&#8221; he was saying.
&#8220;Was it your rifles, or was it trade that stopped an
attack on these cabins night before last? When
will you learn that you can not stop Indian wars
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
until you&#8217;ve killed every Indian this side the mountains?
Has there ever been a time when you or
your fathers could stop their raids with rifles?
Well, you&#8217;ve seen one raid stopped by the influence
of trade.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he paused for breath the girl quietly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, answer me.&#8221;</p>
<p>And I blurted out:</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any idea that Black Hoof and his
warriors will hesitate a second in sacking Howard&#8217;s
Creek because of anything your father has
said or could say. I honestly believe the Shawnees
are playing a game, that they are hoping the settlers
are silly enough to think themselves safe. I am convinced
that once Black Hoof believes the settlers are
in that frame of mind he will return and strike just
as venomously as the Shawnees struck in the old
French War and in Pontiac&#8217;s War, after feasting
with the whites and making them believe the red
man was their friend.&#8221;</p>
<p>She straightened and drew a deep breath, and in
a low voice said:</p>
<p>&#8220;At last you&#8217;ve answered me. Now go!&#8221;</p>
<p>I withdrew from the cabin and from the group
of men. Dale&#8217;s heavy voice was doubly hateful in
my ears. The settlement was a small place. Patsy
had dismissed me, and there was scarcely room for
me without my presence giving her annoyance. I
went to the cabin where I had left my few belongings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
and filled my powder-horn and shot-pouch.
I renewed my stock of flints and added to my roll
of buckskins, not forgetting a fresh supply of
&#8220;whangs&#8221; for sewing my moccasins. While thus
engaged Uncle Dick came in and began sharpening
his knife at the fireplace.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why do that?&#8221; I morosely asked. &#8220;You are
safe from Indian attacks now the trader has told the
Shawnees you are under his protection.&#8221;</p>
<p>He leered at me cunningly and ran his thumb
along the edge of the knife and muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;If some o&#8217; th&#8217; varmints will only git within
strikin&#8217;-distance! They sure ran away night before
last, but how far did they go? Dale seems to have
a pert amount o&#8217; authority over &#8217;em; but how long&#8217;s
he goin&#8217; to stay here? He can&#8217;t go trapezin&#8217; up &#8217;n&#8217;
down these valleys and keep men &#8217;n&#8217; women from
bein&#8217; killed by jest hangin&#8217; some white wampum on
&#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What do the men think?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Them that has famblies are hopin&#8217; th&#8217; critters
won&#8217;t come back. Younger men want to git a crack
at &#8217;em. Two nights ago th&#8217; younkers thought Dale
was mighty strong medicine. A night or two of
sleep leaves &#8217;em &#8217;lowin&#8217; th&#8217; creek may be safe s&#8217;long
as he sticks here. Some t&#8217;others spit it right out
that Black Hoof is playin&#8217; one o&#8217; his Injun games.
If that pert young petticoat wa&#8217;n&#8217;t here mebbe we
could git some o&#8217; th&#8217; young men out into th&#8217; woods
for to do some real scoutin&#8217;.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If my eyes was right I&#8217;d go. As it is, th&#8217; young
folks keep runnin&#8217; a circle round th&#8217; settlement,
lickety-larrup, an&#8217; their minds is on th&#8217; gal, an&#8217; they
wouldn&#8217;t see a buf&#8217;lo if one crossed their path. Then
they hustle back an&#8217; say as how they ain&#8217;t seen
nothin&#8217;. I &#8217;low some o&#8217; th&#8217; older men will have to
scout.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out. I&#8217;ll find the Indians&#8217; trail and
follow it,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be neighborly of you. If they chase you
back an&#8217; git within stickin&#8217;-distance I&#8217;ll soon have
their in&#8217;ards out to dry.&#8221;</p>
<p>I decided to leave my horse, as the travel would
take me through rough places. Shouldering my
rifle, I struck for the western side of the clearing.
Dale had disappeared, gone into the Davis cabin, I
assumed, as John Ward was lying on the ground
near the door. I hadn&#8217;t seen much of Ward for
two days. Davis and Moulton were drawing
leather through a tan trough, and I turned aside to
speak with them. They noticed I was fitted out for
a scout and their faces lighted a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ward&#8217;s been out ag&#8217;in and says the reds went
north toward Tygart&#8217;s Valley. He follered &#8217;em
quite some considerable. If you can find any new
signs an&#8217; can fetch us word&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going out for, Davis. How do
you feel about the doings of night before last?&#8221;</p>
<p>He scratched his chin and after a bit of hesitation
answered:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wife&#8217;s cousin is a mighty smart man. Powerful
smart. I &#8217;low he knows a heap &#8217;bout Injuns. Been
with &#8217;em so much. But we&#8217;re sorter uneasy. More
so to-day than we was yesterday. This waiting to
see what&#8217;ll happen is most as bad, if not worse,
than to have a fight an&#8217; have it over with. Once a
parcel of Injuns strikes, it either cleans us out or is
licked an&#8217; don&#8217;t want no more for a long time. Still
Dale has a master lot of power among the Injuns.
But we&#8217;ll be glad to know you&#8217;re out looking for
fresh footing. Their trail oughter be easy to foller,
as there was a smart number of &#8217;em had hosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll find the trail easy enough, and I&#8217;ll satisfy
myself they are still making toward the Ohio or
have swung back,&#8221; I assured him. &#8220;While I&#8217;m
gone keep the young men in the woods and post
sentinels. Don&#8217;t get careless. Don&#8217;t let the children
wander from the cabins. I&#8217;m free to tell you, Davis,
that I don&#8217;t believe for a second that you&#8217;ve seen
the last of Black Hoof and his men. Have all those
living in the outlying cabins use the fort to-night.&#8221;</p>
<p>After reaching the woods, I turned and looked
back. Dale was standing in the doorway with one
hand resting on the shoulder of John Ward. Ward
was talking to Patsy, whose dainty figure could not
be disguised by the coarse linsey gown.</p>
<p>The man Ward must have lost some of his taciturnity,
for the girl was laughing gaily at whatever
he was saying. I observed that Dale was still feeling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
very important in his rôle of protector, for as
he stepped from the doorway he walked with a
swagger. Well, God give that he was right and
that the menace had passed from Howard&#8217;s Creek.</p>
<p>I found the trail where it turned back toward
Tygart&#8217;s Valley, even as John Ward had reported,
and followed it up the Greenbriar. The country
here was very fertile on both sides of the river and
would make rich farms should the danger from the
Indians ever permit it to be settled. Farther back
from the river on each hand the country was broken
and mountainous and afforded excellent hiding-places
for large bodies of Indians, as only rattlesnakes,
copperheads, wolves and wildcats lived there.</p>
<p>My mood was equal to overdaring, and all because
of Patsy Dale. When the sun swung into its
western arc I halted where a large number of warriors
had broken their fast. I ate some food and
pushed on. After two miles of travel I came to a
branching of the trail. Two of the band had turned
off to the northeast. My interest instantly shifted
from the main trail to the smaller one, for I assumed
the two were scouting some particular neighborhood,
and that by following it I would learn the
object of their attention and be enabled to give
warning.</p>
<p>That done, the footing would lead me back to
the main band. The signs were few and barely
sufficient to allow me to keep up the pursuit. It
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
was not until I came to a spring, the overflow of
which had made muck of the ground, that I was
afforded an opportunity to inspect the two sets of
tracks. One set was made by moccasins almost as
small as those I had given to Patricia Dale.</p>
<p>But why a squaw on a war-path? It was very
puzzling. From the amount of moisture already
seeped into the tracks I estimated the two of them
had stood there within thirty minutes. My pursuit
became more cautious. Not more than twenty rods
from the spring I came to a trail swinging in from
the east, as shown by a broken vine and a bent bush.</p>
<p>The newcomer had moved carelessly and had
fallen in behind the two Indians. I stuck to the
trail until the diminished sunlight warned me it
would soon be too dark to continue. Then I caught
a whiff of burning wood and in ten minutes I was
reconnoitering a tiny glade.</p>
<p>My first glance took in a small fire; my second
glance dwelt upon a scene that sent me into the open
on the jump. An Indian sat at the foot of a walnut-tree,
his legs crossed and his empty hands hanging
over his knees. At one side crouched a squaw, her
long hair falling on each side of her face and hiding
her profile. In a direct line between me and the
warrior stood Shelby Cousin, his rifle bearing on
the warrior.</p>
<p>My step caused him to turn, expecting to behold
another native. The man on the ground made no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
attempt to take advantage of the interruption; and
in the next second Cousin&#8217;s long double-barrel rifle
was again aiming at the painted chest.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go for to try any sp&#8217;ilin&#8217; o&#8217; my game,&#8221;
warned Cousin without looking at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re scouts from a big band of Shawnees
now making toward Tygart&#8217;s Valley,&#8221; I informed
him. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we learn something from them?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill this one now. The squaw can
go. Crabtree would snuff her out, but I ain&#8217;t
reached the p&#8217;int where I can do that yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You coward!&#8221; cried the squaw in excellent English.</p>
<p>Cousin darted a puzzled glance at her. His victim
seemed to be indifferent to his fate; nor did the
woman offer to interfere.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a white woman!&#8221; I cried. For a sunbeam
straggled through the growth and rested on the
long hair and revealed it to be fine and brown and
never to be mistaken for the coarse black locks of
an Indian.</p>
<p>&#8220;White?&#8221; faltered Cousin, lowering his rifle.
&#8220;Watch that devil, Morris!&#8221;</p>
<p>I dropped on a log with my rifle across my knees.
Cousin strode to the woman and caught her by the
shoulder and pulled her to her feet. For a long
minute the two stared.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shelby?&#8221;</p>
<p>The words dropped from her lips in a sibilous
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
crescendo as her blood drove her to a display of
emotion.</p>
<p>Cousin&#8217;s hands slowly advanced and pushed back
the long locks. He advanced his face close to hers,
and I knew his slight form was trembling. Then
he staggered back and jerkily brought his arm
across his eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;God! It&#8217;s my sister!&#8221; I heard him mutter.</p>
<p>I leaped to my feet, crying out for him to be a
man. He remained motionless with his arm across
his face, helpless to defend himself. I turned to the
woman. Whatever light had shone in her eyes
when memory forced his name from her lips had
departed.</p>
<p>Her face was cold and immobile as she met my
wild gaze. There was a streak of yellow paint running
from the bridge of her nose to the parting of
her brown hair. Her skin was as dark as any
Shawnee&#8217;s, but her eyes held the blue of the cornflower.</p>
<p>I tried to discover points of resemblance between
her and the boy and succeeded only when she turned
her head in profile; then they were very much alike.
He lowered his arm to look over it, and she watched
him without changing her expression.</p>
<p>With a hoarse cry he straightened and answering
the impulse in his heart, sprang toward her, his
arms outstretched to enfold her. She gave ground,
not hastily as though wishing to avoid his embrace,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
but with a sinuous twist of her lithe body, and she
repulsed him by raising her hand. He stared at
her stupidly, and mumbled:</p>
<p>&#8220;You remember me. You called my name. You
know I am your brother. You know we lived on
Keeney&#8217;s Knob. You remember the creek&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember,&#8221; she quietly interrupted. &#8220;A very
long time ago. Very long. I am a Shawnee now.
My heart is red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Her words stunned him for a bit, then he managed
to gasp out, &#8220;Who is this man?&#8221; And he
glared at the warrior seated at the foot of the tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;My husband.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy&#8217;s mouth popped open, but without uttering
a sound he stooped and grabbed for his rifle. I
placed my foot on it and seized his arm and pleaded
with him to regain his senses before he took any
action. During all this the warrior remained as
passive as the tree-roots against which he half-reclined.</p>
<p>After a brief hysterical outburst Cousin stood
erect and ceased struggling with me. And all the
time his sister had watched us speculatively, her
gaze as cold and impersonal as though she had been
looking at a rock. It was very hideous. It was
one of those damnable situations which must end at
once, and to which there can be no end. For the
boy to kill his sister&#8217;s husband was an awful thing
to contemplate.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></p>
<p>I pulled the lad back and softly whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t do it. The blood would always be
between you two. She has changed. She believes
she is red. Take her aside and talk with her. If she
will go with you make for the mountains and get
her to the settlements.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will wait an hour. If you two do not return
before an hour&mdash;Well, he will not bother you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first he did not seem to understand; then he
seized my free hand and gripped it tightly. Taking
his rifle, he approached the girl and took her by the
arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come,&#8221; he gently told her. &#8220;We must talk, you
and I. I have hunted for you for years.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was suspicious of us two, but she did not
resist him.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>She glided to the savage and leaned over him and
said something. Then she was back to her brother,
and the two disappeared into the woods.</p>
<p>I drew a line on the savage and in Shawnee
demanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Throw me the knife she gave you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Glaring at me sullenly, he flipped the knife toward
the fire and resumed his attitude of abstraction. I
had never killed an unarmed Indian. I had never
shot one in cold blood. The office of executioner
did not appeal, but repulsive as it was it would not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
do for the boy to kill his savage brother-in-law.
Lost Sister and the savage were man and wife, even
if married according to the Indian custom.</p>
<p>Nor would it do for a woman of Virginia to be
redeemed to civilization with a red husband roaming
at large. No. The fellow must die, and I had
the nasty work to do. The glade was thickening
with shadows, but the sunlight still marked the top
of an elm and made glorious the zenith. When the
light died from the heavens I would assassinate the
man.</p>
<p>This would give him a scant hour, but a dozen or
fifteen minutes of life could make small difference.
Then again, once the dusk filled the glade my impassive
victim would become alert and up to some of
his devilish tricks. He did not change his position
except as he turned his head to gaze fixedly at the
western forest wall. One could imagine him to be
ignorant of my presence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where does Black Hoof lead his warriors?&#8221; I
asked him.</p>
<p>Without deflecting his gaze he answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Back to their homes on the Scioto.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The white trader, the Pack-Horse-Man, spoke
words that drive them back?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was either a trick of the dying light, or else I
detected an almost imperceptible twitching of the
grim lips. After a short pause he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Shawnees are not driven. They will pick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
up the end of the peace-belt. They will not drop it
on the ground again. Tah-gah-jute (Logan) does
not wish for war. He has taken ten scalps for every
one taken from his people at Baker&#8217;s house. He
has covered the dead. The Pack-Horse-Man spoke
wise words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This white woman? You know she must go
back to her people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again the faint twitching of the lips. When he
spoke it was to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;She can go where she will or where she is made
to go. If she is taken to the white settlements she
will run away and go back to the Scioto. Her people
are red. After the French War, after Pontiac&#8217;s
War, it was the same. White prisoners were
returned to the white people. Many of them escaped
and came back to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>His voice was calm and positive and my confidence
in the girl&#8217;s willingness to return to civilization
was shaken. She had been as stolid as her red
mate in my presence, but I had believed that nature
would conquer her ten years&#8217; of savagery once she
was alone with her brother.</p>
<p>The light had left the top of the elm and the
fleecy clouds overhead were no longer dazzling
because of their borrowed splendor. I cocked my
rifle. The savage folded his arms as he caught the
sound, but his gaze toward the west never wavered.
To nerve myself into shooting the fellow in cold
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
blood I made myself think of the girl&#8217;s terrible fate,
and was succeeding rapidly when a light step
sounded behind me and her low voice was saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother is at the spring. You will find him
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I rose and dropped the rifle into the hollow of my
left arm and stared at her incredulously. It had
happened before, the rebellion of white prisoners at
quitting their captors. Yet the girl&#8217;s refusal was
astounding.</p>
<p>&#8220;You would not go with him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here. I go to my people,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;He is waiting for you. The squaws would laugh
at him. He is very weak.&#8221;</p>
<p>With an oath I whirled toward the Indian. Had
he made a move or had he reflected her disdain with
a smile, his white-red wife surely would have been
a widow on the spot. But he had not shifted his
position. To all appearances he was not even interested
in his wife&#8217;s return. And she too now ignored
me, and busied herself in gathering up their few
belongings and slinging them on her back. Then
she went to him, and in disgust and rage I left them
and sped through the darkening woods to the spring
where I had first seen the imprints of her tiny moccasins.</p>
<p>Cousin was there, seated and his head bowed on
his chest, a waiting victim for the first Indian scout
who might happen along.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>I dragged him to his feet and harshly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Come! We must go. Your white sister is dead.
Your search is ended. Your sister died in the raid
on Keeney&#8217;s Knob.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My little sister,&#8221; he whispered.</p>
<p>He went with me passively enough, and he did
not speak until we had struck into the main trail of
the Shawnees. Then he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not kill him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s best that way. There&#8217;re &#8217;nough others.
They&#8217;ll pay for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I abandoned my plan of following the war-party
farther and was only anxious to get my companion
back to the protection of Howard&#8217;s Creek. We followed
the back-trail for a few miles and then were
forced by the night to make a camp. I opened my
supply of smoked meat and found a spring. I did
not dare to risk a fire. But he would not eat. Only
once did he speak that night, and that was to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;I must keep clear o&#8217; the settlements. If I don&#8217;t
I&#8217;ll do as Ike Crabtree does, kill in sight o&#8217; the
cabins.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the morning he ate some of my food; not as if
he were hungry, but as if forcing himself to a disagreeable
task. He seemed to be perfectly willing
to go on with me, but he did not speak of the girl
again.</p>
<p>When we drew near the creek he began to look
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
about him. He at once recognized the surroundings
and made a heroic effort to control himself. When
we swung into the clearing there was nothing in his
appearance to denote the terrible experience he had
passed through.</p>
<p>Now that we were back I was beset by a fear, that
the sight of Patricia in all her loveliness would be
an overwhelming shock to his poor brain. It was
with great relief that I got him to the Moulton cabin
without his glimpsing Patsy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can tell &#8217;em if you want to. S&#8217;pose they&#8217;ll
l&#8217;arn it some time,&#8221; he said to me as we reached the
door and met Mrs. Moulton and her little girl.
With that he passed inside and seated himself in a
corner and bowed his head.</p>
<p>I drew Mrs. Moulton aside and briefly explained
his great sorrow. With rich sympathy she stole into
the cabin and began mothering him, patting his
shoulders and stroking the long hair back from his
wan face.</p>
<p>My own affairs became of small importance when
measured beside this tragedy. I had no trepidation
now in facing Patricia. I walked boldly to the
Davis cabin and thrust my head in the door. Only
Davis and his wife were there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the Dales?&#8221; I bruskly asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone,&#8221; grunted Davis in disgust.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gone back home?&#8221; I eagerly asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you think!&#8221; babbled Mrs. Davis.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
&#8220;Cousin Ericus has took that gal down toward the
Clinch. He &#8217;lows now he&#8217;s goin&#8217; to keep the Injuns
out of that valley&mdash;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! Why did you let them go?&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis snorted angrily, and exclaimed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em go! How ye goin&#8217; to stop her? &#8217;Twas
she that was bound to be movin&#8217; on. Just made her
daddy go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When did they start?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Right after you lit out. Seems &#8217;s if th&#8217; gal
couldn&#8217;t git shut o&#8217; this creek quick &#8217;nough.&#8221;</p>
<p>I ran from the cabin to get my horse and start in
immediate pursuit. By the time I reached the
animal, well rested during my absence, I became
more reasonable. After all Black Hoof was traveling
north. There would be small chance of another
band raiding down the Clinch for some time at
least. I needed rest. Night travel would advance
me but slowly. I would start early in the morning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>IN ABB&#8217;S VALLEY</h3>
</div>

<p>Orioles and mocking-birds sang in the openings,
and startled deer fled before our advance
as Shelby Cousin and I rode for the Clinch. The
heat of July was tempered by a breeze out of the
north, and the heavens were filled with hurrying
white argosies. So it had ever been since the white
man came to these pleasant ridges and rich bottom-lands;
perfume, song, gracious valleys, and the lurking
red evil.</p>
<p>Cousin had regained his self-control overnight
and outwardly appeared to be thoroughly composed.
He talked but little, and then only when I took the
lead. I refrained from mentioning the tragedy of
yesterday and the sun was noon-high before he
brought the matter up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t kill that feller,&#8221; he abruptly informed
me.</p>
<p>There was no preface to indicate whom he meant,
but I knew and nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;An&#8217; I&#8217;d ruther kill him than all the rest o&#8217; the
Injuns &#8217;tween here &#8217;n&#8217; Detroit,&#8221; he added after a
long pause.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She will never come back to us?&#8221; I asked; for
he had given no details of his interview with his
sister.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll never come back. For a time I&#8217;d a mind
to drag her away, but she was so cold to me, so
Injun-like in her way of lettin&#8217; me know it wouldn&#8217;t
do no good, that I give it up. You see she was only
a child when captured. Women caught when much
older&#8217;n her have gone for to choose a wigwam to a
cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish I had shot him?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No. If it could happen in a open fight&mdash;that&#8217;s
different. It wouldn&#8217;t do any good to hurt her by
killin&#8217; him. But I wish he was dead!&#8221;</p>
<p>We stopped and ate and rode several miles before
either of us spoke again. Then I said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a girl ahead, about your age.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was disturbed to hear it and I feared he would
wish to leave me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want her captured by Indians,&#8221; I added.</p>
<p>&#8220;God forbid it!&#8221; he hoarsely cried.</p>
<p>Having prepared him for seeing Patricia, I
shifted his line of thought by asking, &#8220;What do
you think of John Ward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Injun.&#8221;</p>
<p>I said nothing and after a few minutes he went
on:</p>
<p>&#8220;Took by Injuns when a little boy, just like
Tavenor Ross and George Collet was took. I&#8217;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
heard traders tell about the three of &#8217;em. When
they&#8217;re took so young they grow up just as much
Injuns as if they was born red. Ward&#8217;s that way.
Must be. Look at the sister I lost!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But Ward comes back to settlements. He even
crosses the mountains. He says he escaped.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He wouldn&#8217;t be travelin&#8217; round these parts if he
was a&#8217; &#8217;scaped prisoner. As for crossin&#8217; the mountains
he might &#8217;a&#8217; gone for to see what he could see.
Cornstalk has spies all up an&#8217; down the frontier. I
&#8217;low them two we met yesterday was bent on spyin&#8217;.
God! That&#8217;s a&#8217; awful thought! But I ain&#8217;t got no
sister. It was a red woman we seen. She &#8217;n&#8217; her
man was spyin&#8217;. If not that why should they be
makin&#8217; east into the mountains? I &#8217;low he was to
stay hid while &#8217;nother &#8217;scaped prisoner rode down
into some settlement.&#8221;</p>
<p>From that speech on I do not remember that he
spoke of his sister as being any kin of his. When
he must mention her he usually styled her, &#8220;That
woman who&#8217;s turned red.&#8221;</p>
<p>To get his thoughts away from her I rattled on
about my trip to Richfield and told of my experiences
in returning over the mountains. After I
had narrated Hughes&#8217; quick action in saving me
from an assassin&#8217;s bullet Cousin jerked up his head
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Moccasin, one you give to that there young
woman we&#8217;re now followin&#8217;?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span></p>
<p>I nodded, and he continued:</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low it was John Ward who tried to pot you.
He stole the moccasin and sneaked back an&#8217; laid the
trap. Prob&#8217;ly laid it for whoever come along without
knowin&#8217; who would walk into it. You was
mighty lucky to have Hughes there.&#8221; I had never
connected Ward with that attempt on my life.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Dales believe Ward to be what he pretends&mdash;an
escaped prisoner,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Course they do,&#8221; sighed the boy. &#8220;The country&#8217;s
full of fools. After he&#8217;s led &#8217;em to the stake
an&#8217; they begin to roast they&#8217;ll wake up an&#8217; reckon
that there&#8217;s something wrong with his white blood.&#8221;</p>
<p>His matter-of-fact way of expressing it made my
blood congeal. It was unthinkable to imagine Patsy
Dale in the hands of the Indians. I urged my horse
to a sharper clip, but Cousin warned me:</p>
<p>&#8220;No use hurryin&#8217;. Save your nag for the time
when you&#8217;ll need him mighty bad. I &#8217;low we can
overtake &#8217;em afore anything happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>We had discovered no fresh Indian-signs. Black
Hoof and his braves were far north of us. We
knew scouts were ranging up the Clinch and Holston,
and that the people were forting from Fort
Chiswell to the head of the Holston, and that practically
all the settlers had left Rich Valley between
Walker&#8217;s Mountain and the north fork of the Holston.</p>
<p>Nearly all the settlers had come off the heads of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
Sandy and Walker&#8217;s Creeks and were building forts
at David Doack&#8217;s mill on the Clinch and on the
head waters of the middle fork of the Holston, as
well as at Gasper Kinder&#8217;s place in Poor Valley.</p>
<p>Cornstalk must know the time was near when the
whites would send an army against the Shawnee
towns north of the Ohio, and he was too cunning a
warrior to risk sending many of his men into southwestern
Virginia. Black Hoof was there with a
large force, but he could not tarry without leaving
the Scioto towns uncovered.</p>
<p>Therefore my opinion coincided with my companion&#8217;s,
once my first flurry of fear was expended.
The Dales were in no immediate danger, and if any
hostile band was below New River it would be a
small one. Once more I allowed my horse to take
his time. I began to find room for wondering how
I was to overcome my embarrassment once we did
come up with the Dales.</p>
<p>Ericus Dale would rant and indulge in abuse.
Patricia would be remembering my lack of faith in
her father&#8217;s influence over the natives. She would
want none of my company. But if Cousin and I
could trail them unseen until they entered a small
settlement at the head of the Bluestone, where they
would be sure to pause before making for the head
of the Clinch, we could pretend we were scouting
far south and had met them by accident; then we
could ride on ahead of them.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>Their trail was simple to follow. The Dales were
mounted and Ward was afoot and leading a pack-horse.
We came to their several camps, and at each
of these I observed the girl was wearing my moccasins.
When Cousin would behold the small imprint
his face would twist in anguish. Poor devil!</p>
<p>For three days we leisurely followed them, and
each sunrise found me entertaining fewer fears for
the girl&#8217;s safety. We timed our progress so as to
pitch our last camp within a mile of the settlement
in Abb&#8217;s Valley on the Bluestone, intending to
reconnoiter it for signs of the Dales before showing
ourselves.</p>
<p>The valley was about ten miles long and very narrow
and possessing unusually fertile soil. It was
named after Absalom Looney, a hunter, who claimed
to have discovered it. Cousin informed me there
were three cabins and a small fort in the valley when
he last visited it. At that time one of the families
was planning to cross the mountains and sacrifice
the summer&#8217;s planting.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mebbe they&#8217;ve all come off since then. Or them
that&#8217;s stayed may be killed an&#8217; sculped by this time,&#8221;
he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever may have happened to the settlers is
all finished by this time and there can be no danger
for the Dales,&#8221; I declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low they&#8217;re packin&#8217; their worst danger along
with &#8217;em,&#8221; he mumbled.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning John Ward?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Meaning him,&#8221; was the terse answer.</p>
<p>This set all my fears to galloping again, and they
rode one another close. What if Ward were the
creature Cousin pictured him? Then he must have
designs on the Dales, and he would persuade them to
travel in a direction which would lead them into a
trap. If Ward were &#8220;red&#8221; he already had planned
just where he would bag his game.</p>
<p>Against this line of reasoning was our failure to
discover fresh signs, and the fact that Black Hoof&#8217;s
band was making north. Then one fear drew ahead
of all others, and I was thrown into a panic lest
Ward plotted to count his coup unaided and would
murder the trader and his daughter. I rose from
the fire and announced my intention of proceeding
to the valley settlement that night. I told Cousin
my fears.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just so much foolishness,&#8221; he told me.
&#8220;If Ward&#8217;s up to them sort o&#8217; tricks he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; made
his kill when only a few miles from Howard&#8217;s Creek,
when he was that much closer to Black Hoof&#8217;s band.
Then he&#8217;d &#8217;a&#8217; sneaked north to j&#8217;in his red friends
and dance his sculps. But we&#8217;ve found all their
camps, and nothin&#8217; has happened. They&#8217;re safe so
far.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was near morning before I could sleep and I
awoke at sunrise. Cousin was missing. I investigated
and discovered he had gone on foot, so I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
assumed he was out to kill some meat to pack into
the settlement. I prepared something to eat and
finished my portion and was kneeling to drink from
a spring when I heard him coming through the
woods. He was running and making much noise,
and I had a presentiment that something very evil
had happened. Before he came into view he called
my name sharply.</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! I&#8217;m here! What is it?&#8221; I answered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Devil&#8217;s come for his pay!&#8221; he snapped as he
burst through the last of the growth. &#8220;Only two
miles west fresh tracks of big war-party makin&#8217;
south. They&#8217;re makin&#8217; for Abb&#8217;s Valley. That
white-Injun devil fixed it up. Goin&#8217; to gobble the
settlers along with your fool friends. If we can&#8217;t
stop &#8217;em they&#8217;ll git every white in the valley sure&#8217;s
Sabba&#8217;day preachin&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Until that moment I had never dreamed of the
exquisite torture that the threat of an Indian raid
could induce. I secured my weapons and mounted
without realizing what I was doing. My first coherent
thought was one of amazement to behold Cousin
stuffing smoked meat into his pack with one hand
while the other held a tough morsel for his teeth to
tear at. He ate like a famished wolf.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t fight without some linin&#8217;,&#8221; he mumbled.
&#8220;An&#8217; we&#8217;ll take what&#8217;s left along. May git in a
corner an&#8217; have mighty little time for cookin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I urged my horse into a gallop. Cousin tore after
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
me, angrily calling on me to wait. I was in no mood
to wait, and endeavored to get even more speed out
of my animal. Then Cousin brought me to my
senses by yelling:</p>
<p>&#8220;All right! Kill &#8217;em if you want to!&#8221;</p>
<p>I pulled in and he drove alongside, crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;First thing you know you&#8217;ll be runnin&#8217; into a
nest o&#8217; them devils. Their path and our path draws
together an&#8217; enters the valley as one path.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But we must reach the valley ahead of them!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t be did,&#8221; he discouraged. &#8220;Best we can
do is to sneak up on &#8217;em without bein&#8217; seen.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a last hope I suggested:</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps after all they know nothing about the
Dales.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They know &#8217;bout Abb&#8217;s Valley. It&#8217;s Black
Hoof&#8217;s band. Made off north, then swung back
down here, keepin&#8217; clear o&#8217; Howard&#8217;s Creek. If
they clean out Abb&#8217;s Valley they&#8217;ll clean out the
creek on their way home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Scant consolation in all this. It was a great relief
to reach the Bluestone and prepare for action. We
spanceled our horses in a tiny opening well surrounded
by woods. Cousin was familiar with the
country and led the way. Instead of making for
the mouth of the narrow valley we gained the end
of one of its enclosing ridges and scouted along
the slope.</p>
<p>When we halted and Cousin carefully parted the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
bushes I observed we were behind three cabins and
high enough up the slope to see over them. The
valley at this point was not more than fifty rods
wide, and appeared to be even less because of the
long walls stretching away for ten miles.</p>
<p>Some children were laughing at their play and
were hidden from view as long as they kept close to
the door of the middle cabin. A dog was growling
and barking, but as he did not join the sport of the
little ones we concluded he was tied. One of the red
cabins, that nearest to the mouth of the valley, did
not appear to be occupied.</p>
<p>Through the small window of the cabin farthest
up the valley I glimpsed two persons moving about
when they passed between the window and the open
door. A few rods farther out toward the middle
of the valley and nearer the Bluestone than the unoccupied
cabin, were the four walls of what had been
intended for a fort. It lacked the roof. For some
reason the men had suspended work on it, being too
few to complete it, or else deciding the cabins furnished
sufficient protection.</p>
<p>Three men, all strangers to me, now entered our
line of vision as they walked out from the shelter of
the middle cabin. Cousin told me their names. The
tall man with the long black beard was Granville,
one of the original settlers. He and his wife and
two children, with Mrs. Granville&#8217;s sister, lived in
the middle cabin. A short swarthy man was Nate
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
Dicks. He had sent his family over the mountains
and was staying behind to gather the season&#8217;s crops,
explained Cousin. The third man was along in
years and walked with a limp.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the old Englishman. All the name he
goes by. No kin to any one on this side the ocean,
he says. He lives with the Granvilles. The empty
cabin belonged to the Drakes. They pulled out
early this spring. Dicks lives in the t&#8217;other-end
cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I make out at least two people in there now,&#8221; I
murmured.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll be the Dales. Dicks&#8217;s prob&#8217;ly sleepin&#8217; in
the Granville cabin.&#8221;</p>
<p>My heart behaved badly for a minute.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to that pup!&#8221; softly exclaimed Cousin,
his brows drawing down. &#8220;The fools have him tied
up, an they ain&#8217;t got sense &#8217;nough to hark to what
he&#8217;s tryin&#8217; to tell &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here ahead of the Indians. Let&#8217;s go
down,&#8221; I urged.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait! Look across!&#8221; He pointed to the wall
of woods opposite our hiding-place. John Ward
had broken cover and was stalking toward the
cabins. The black cloth he wore around his head
gave him a sinister, piratical appearance and his feet
tracked like an Indian&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I would have descended the slope but Cousin
clutched my arm, whispering:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If there ain&#8217;t no Injuns across the valley we can
afford to wait a bit. If there is, our goin&#8217; down
would hurry up their attack. It won&#8217;t do to call out
an&#8217; scare &#8217;em so they&#8217;ll scatter. As they are now
they can fort themselves in the shake of a dog&#8217;s
tail.&#8221;</p>
<p>Two women, Mrs. Granville and her sister, now
walked back of the middle cabin and picked up some
wood. Both were barefooted, and I was close
enough to read the expression of constant fear on
each face. As they stooped for the wood their gaze
was continually roving over the woods on our ridge,
and often their fingers fumbled for a fagot while
their eyes persisted in examining the forest.</p>
<p>Now Dale and Patsy emerged from their cabin
and walked to meet Ward. Cousin groaned aloud
as he beheld the girl. There was something in her
appearance to remind him of his lost sister. Ericus
Dale greeted Ward with a wide flourish of his hand.
Ward was emotionless as a Shawnee chief. Granville
and Dicks hurried to join the three, anxious
no doubt to learn the result of Ward&#8217;s scouting.</p>
<p>His report seemed to please the men, for Granville
laid aside his rifle and began chopping a long
log into fireplace lengths. Dicks walked toward
the middle cabin, lustily singing:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>

<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>A modern fact in jingling verse.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>This song, six or seven lengthy stanzas in all, was
written by Mr. George Campbell, an Irish gentleman,
and was popular along the frontier. It was
sung to the tune of the Black Joke, and commemorated
the successful efforts of Captain James Smith
to prevent Philadelphia traders from sending weapons
of war to the northwest tribes shortly after the
treaty of 1765 was concluded.</p>
<p>Dicks was finishing the first stanza as he entered
the cabin. He broke off sharply to rebuke the dog.
Soon he came out with a bag. At about a hundred
yards from the cabin, and farther up the valley than
any of them, was the lick-block. Dicks was walking
toward this. Several horses broke from the growth
across the valley and ran toward the cabins.</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost act like they was skeered,&#8221; whispered
Cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Coming in to be salted,&#8221; I corrected as the
horses swerved and galloped toward the block.
Dicks was ambling along slowly and reverting to
his song. The dog suddenly darted from the cabin
and streaked after Dicks, a piece of rawhide trailing
from his neck. As he ran he made a great outcry.
Dicks was very angry to have his vocal efforts interrupted,
and he halted and swung the bag of salt in
an attempt to hit the dog, all the while commanding
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
him to go back. The horses were now at the block
and stepping about uneasily.</p>
<p>&#8220;I never guessed that! Come on! Something
will bu&#8217;st loose in a minute!&#8221; groaned Cousin.</p>
<p>We started to slide down the bank, when a terrible
tragedy took place before our eyes. As Dicks
was emptying the salt on to the lick-block the horses
sprang back and bolted in alarm, and an Indian&#8217;s
topknot, decorated with wild-turkey feathers, bobbed
up from behind the block. Dicks seemed to be
paralyzed. The savage struck him with his ax and
the unfortunate man went down, dead before he lost
his footing. In the next second the dog, a huge
brute of mongrel breed, cleared the block and closed
his jaws on the murderer&#8217;s neck.</p>
<p>This was a signal for Cousin&#8217;s prophecy to come
true. A deafening chorus of howls burst from the
woods opposite the cabins, and a volley of bullets
rained among the settlers. Mrs. Granville and the
two children dropped. The old Englishman, standing
nearer the cabins, staggered and turned around
two or three times. Granville, unharmed, picked
up the body of his wife.</p>
<p>The old Englishman was very brave, for he
limped forward and managed to gather up the children,
one under each arm. Granville&#8217;s sister was
practical enough to secure her brother-in-law&#8217;s rifle
and ax. The three, with their dead, made for the
middle cabin.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span></p>
<p>All this happened in the wink of an eye. The
Dales and Ward, walking toward the end cabin
when Dicks was killed, halted and stood as if stupefied.
None of the bullets had reached them. The
girl seized her father&#8217;s arm and led him to shelter.
He was unhurt, but he moved with shuffling steps,
much like a tavern-loafer soggy from rum.</p>
<p>We ran to enter the nearest cabin, which happened
to be Granville&#8217;s, but the door was slammed
and barred before we could round the corner.</p>
<p>&#8220;In here!&#8221; sharply cried Cousin, darting through
the doorway of the empty cabin.</p>
<p>As I piled in after him I saw Patsy and Dale entering
their cabin, but Ward, the white Indian, was
running to cover up the valley. And not a savage
had shown himself with the exception of the one
who had counted coup at the lick-block. This fellow
was still in sight and extremely busy.</p>
<p>With our door ajar we watched the ghastly
struggle between the faithful mongrel and the
assassin. The Indian had lost his ax but had managed
to draw his knife. The dog&#8217;s teeth were buried
in his throat before he could get his blade loose.
I raised my rifle but Cousin laughed and knocked
it aside and cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let him make his kill! It&#8217;s his coup!&#8221;</p>
<p>The warrior staggered clear of the block, his
desperate plight blinding him to all else. His eyes
were protruding. He stabbed blindly. I cried out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
in pain as I saw the knife sink to the hilt. But the
faithful beast had locked his jaws and the weight
of his body was already ripping the red throat open.
Dead dog and dying warrior fell side by side. The
dog had counted the first coup for the whites.</p>
<p>Now we caught our first view of the enemy. A
long line of Shawnees emerged from the woods,
running and leaping and jumping from side to side,
sinking behind stumps and vanishing behind the
scattered trees.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got time to make the ridge back o&#8217; here,&#8221;
spoke up Cousin. &#8220;We&#8217;s fools to come in here.
S&#8217;pose we go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You go! I must stick,&#8221; I told him.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can do &#8217;em more good out in the open than
by bein&#8217; cooped up in here,&#8221; he quietly reasoned.</p>
<p>&#8220;You go. I can&#8217;t leave the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then bar the door,&#8221; he commanded.</p>
<p>I did so, and through a loophole knocked over a
savage who had paused in the open to brandish a
war-ax thickly decorated with either feathers or
scalps.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good! We&#8217;ll make a fine fight of it!&#8221; grimly
said Cousin as he stepped from a loophole at the
back of the cabin. &#8220;It&#8217;s too late for us to make the
ridge now. It&#8217;s crawlin&#8217; with the vermin.&#8221;</p>
<p>His bearing was exceedingly cheerful as he posted
himself at the front of the cabin, his double-barrel
rifle ready for a snap-shot. He fired the two barrels
almost together, and laughed boisterously.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Two tryin&#8217; to hide behind one small tree,&#8221; he
explained. &#8220;Got one dead an&#8217; sp&#8217;iled t&#8217;other.&#8221;</p>
<p>As yet not a shot had been fired from the other
two cabins. A voice called from the Granville
cabin. I found a chink in the wall and beheld the
face of the Englishman peering from the small end
window.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s there?&#8221; he kept demanding in a shrill
voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Two white scouts. Get to shooting!&#8221;</p>
<p>He could not see me but he heard me, and vanished
to help in the defense. Cousin had reloaded
and was watching the valley closely. Bullets were
plunking into the log walls, but I knew none of the
savages were exposing themselves, else my companion
would be shooting. From the Granville cabin
several shots were fired without any effect so far
as we could make out. Then again the Englishman
was calling us. I went forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hear what I say?&#8221; he cried.</p>
<p>I answered that we could.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ericus Dale says for us to stop shooting or he
can&#8217;t save us,&#8221; he informed us.</p>
<p>&#8220;He can&#8217;t save himself!&#8221; I yelled back.</p>
<p>&#8220;He thinks he can save all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He couldn&#8217;t save the man at the lick-block,&#8221; I
reminded.</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. There&#8217;s sorry truth in that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This valley&#8217;s a trap. John Ward, the white Indian,
led him and his daughter into it,&#8221; I shouted.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;God help and pity us!&#8221; he groaned. Then more
calmly, &#8220;Ward came back from the woods this
morning and said there were no signs of Indians.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He met them and talked with them, and planned
how they should surprise you people. The warrior
at the lick-block knew Dicks would discover him, so
he showed himself and made his kill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Aye. That is reasonable thinking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What losses in there?&#8221; I asked. I thrust my
knife-blade between the logs so he might know
where I was standing and cease rolling his eyes in
his efforts to locate me.</p>
<p>His old face screwed up in pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mistress Granville and the two children, shot
dead. Perhaps it&#8217;s best that way. I&#8217;m wounded&mdash;that
don&#8217;t count. You going to keep on shooting?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as we can pull trigger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell Granville. He wants to save his sister
if he can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he must fight. Tell him so,&#8221; I warned.</p>
<p>I turned back to Cousin. He was scowling savagely
through his peephole. &#8220;Take the back side
&#8217;n&#8217; watch for signs on the ridge,&#8221; he mumbled.
&#8220;Them out front are huggin&#8217; dirt an&#8217; not tryin&#8217; to
git nearer. They&#8217;re waitin&#8217; for somethin&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the back of the cabin I found a tiny chink and
applied my eye. My first thought was that a comet
was streaming down into my face. The long war-arrow,
weighted with a blazing mass of pitch-smeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
moss, stuck in a log a few inches below my
peephole. From the ridge came a howl of triumph.</p>
<p>By thrusting my knife-blade through the hole and
against the shaft of the arrow I managed to dislodge
it, and it burned itself out against the huge bottom
log. We did not fear fire until the arrows stuck
in the roof. The same thought was in Cousin&#8217;s
mind. He did not look around, but he had smelled
the smoke and he directed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Climb up an&#8217; work the roof-poles apart a bit
so&#8217;s you can knock &#8217;em off the roof when they land.&#8221;</p>
<p>I soon had the poles slightly separated in two
places. As I finished a dozen flying brands poured
down on the Granville cabin and ours. One arrow
lodged on our roof close to the eves. Two were
burning on the ridgepole of the Granville cabin.
The others either stuck harmlessly in the logs or
overshot and stood so many torches in the ground.
By means of the table I scrambled back to the roof
and managed to knock the menace to the ground.
While I was thus engaged Cousin fired both barrels.</p>
<p>&#8220;What luck?&#8221; I asked as I jumped to the floor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just bein&#8217; neighborly,&#8221; he growled as he rapidly
loaded. &#8220;Shot them two arrers off the next roof.&#8221;</p>
<p>Suddenly the savage howling ceased; nor were
there any more fire-arrows. Then the Englishman
began shouting. He was once more calling us. I
answered and wriggled the knife-blade between the
logs. Sure of my attention he loudly informed us:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
&#8220;Dale passes the word for us to stop fighting.
Says he&#8217;s going to save us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;To the devil with Dale!&#8221; snarled Cousin, showing
his teeth like a wolf.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going out to talk with &#8217;em,&#8221; added the
Englishman.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lord! What a fool!&#8221; lamented Cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s going now,&#8221; continued the Englishman.</p>
<p>I darted to Cousin&#8217;s side and peered out. We
heard the bar drop from the end cabin; then Dale
came into view, walking with a swagger toward the
concealed savages. In one hand he held up a string
of white wampum. And as he slowly advanced he
shouted in the Shawnee language:</p>
<p>&#8220;Do my brothers fire on their brother? Do they
harm their brother&#8217;s friends? Does the Pack-Horse-Man
ask his red brothers to be kind only to have
his words fall on dead ears? I bring you belts. My
daughter in the cabin also brings belts to the Shawnees
and Mingos and the Delawares.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let our white brother come close,&#8221; called a
deep guttural voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll be Black Hoof himself,&#8221; excitedly muttered
Cousin, darting his gaze over the valley in
search of the stone or log which hid the great chief
from view.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t shoot! They&#8217;ll butcher him if you do!&#8221;
I warned.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll worse&#8217;n butcher him if I don&#8217;t,&#8221; gritted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
Cousin. Yet he held his fire, for the excellent
reason he could see nothing to shoot at.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell your people not to fire,&#8221; again called Black
Hoof&#8217;s powerful voice.</p>
<p>Dale faced the cabins and waved his white wampum,
crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am saving your lives. You men in the lower
cabin, throw down your arms!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like thunder!&#8221; grunted Cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s fairly among them!&#8221; I gasped.</p>
<p>Dale had come to a stop and was turning his head
and glancing from one point to another on the
ground as he talked. His voice had its old confident
ring, and there was a slight smile on his lips as
he rehearsed his friendship for the red people and
reminded them how often he visited their villages
and smoked their pipes.</p>
<p>When he ceased Black Hoof called out:</p>
<p>&#8220;We will lift a peace-pipe to our good friend, the
Pack-Horse-Man. We will cover his friends with
the smoke. Let him tell his friends not to be afraid
and to throw down their guns.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dale was sure of Granville&#8217;s and the Englishman&#8217;s
behavior, and he addressed his warning to
Cousin and me, calling on us in a stentorian voice
to offer no resistance if we valued our lives. He
ended by yelling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa, war-chief of the Shawnees, spares
your lives.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></p>
<p>Without giving us time to speak, he waved a
hand and commanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all right, Patricia! Come out!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Stay where you are!&#8221; I screamed, my voice
muffled by the four stout walls. I jumped to tear
the bar from the door, but Cousin hurled me aside,
panting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Too late! God! To think such a woman should
walk into their bloody trap!&#8221;</p>
<p>His words sent me to the loophole. Patricia Dale
was walking composedly toward her father, her slim
hands holding up her belts. She winced as she
passed the lick-block and got a glimpse of the dead
savage and the dead dog. Then her gaze remained
steady on her father&#8217;s calm face.</p>
<p>Black Hoof said something, but there was a
pounding in my ears which prevented me from hearing
it. I guessed it, though, when Dale called
out:</p>
<p>&#8220;All you who would be spared come out and leave
your guns behind!&#8221;</p>
<p>He had barely spoken before the Englishman&#8217;s
voice excitedly called:</p>
<p>&#8220;You two scouts in there.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave him heed and he informed me: &#8220;Granville
and his sister say they are going out. Do you go
out?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall stay here. It&#8217;s better for you to die
where you are,&#8221; I told him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Ay, I think it&#8217;s better myself. Well, I&#8217;m old
and hungry to be with the children again.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Englishman was a brave man, and very sensible.
He recognized Fate when it paused to stare
him in the eye. My companion was panting for
breath and was standing back so as to rest the
muzzle of his rifle just inside the loophole. A
glance revealed his deadly purpose. A tall warrior
was now on his feet. I knew him to be Black Hoof.
I had seen him at Fort Pitt during one of those
rare lulls between wars.</p>
<p>Cousin was fairly out of his head with the lust to
kill the chief, but the Shawnee took no chances. He
was careful to keep the girl and her father between
him and the cabins. I pushed Cousin&#8217;s gun aside
and fiercely upbraided him for placing the Dales&#8217;
lives in jeopardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;You fool!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;They&#8217;re gone already.
Are you, too, blind? If you love that gal out there
and want to do her the greatest kindness a man can
ever do to a border woman, shoot her!&#8221;</p>
<p>Granville began shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Me &#8217;n&#8217; my sister are comin&#8217; out. We surrender.
Tell &#8217;em, Mr. Dale! God knows &#8217;nough blood&#8217;s
been spilt.&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard their cabin door open. Then it closed
with a bang and we heard the heavy bar drop into
place. For a moment I believed they had changed
their minds; then they crossed our line of vision,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
the man walking ahead with empty hands held high,
his sister walking behind and wildly waving a white
cloth. It was the Englishman, skeptical, because of
our advice, who dropped the bar.</p>
<p>Cousin began muttering under his breath. I soon
discovered the reason. John Ward was approaching
the group from the opposite side of the valley
and trying to keep some of the whites between him
and our cabin. The nearer he drew to the group,
the easier this maneuver was. Ward had made a
half-circuit of the valley and was advancing through
the lines of hidden braves. Cousin would have tried
a shot at the renegade if not for fear of instant
reprisal on the girl. It was horrible to hear him
curse and moan as he nursed the set of triggers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; I whispered. &#8220;Watch them close!&#8221;</p>
<p>I meant Granville and his sister; for as they
entered the zone held by the enemy I observed a
clump of low bushes dipping and swaying behind
them. The woman saw something that frightened
her, for she pressed close to her brother and shook
the white cloth toward the ground. The grotesque
fancy came into my head that she would do the same
thing if she wanted to shoo some chickens out of a
garden.</p>
<p>Granville and his sister walked up to Black Hoof,
the woman still waving the cloth to make sure the
chief beheld it and recognized its sacred character.
Dale turned to give Cousin, the Englishman and me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
one last chance to save our lives; and the hideous
work began.</p>
<p>John Ward seized Patricia from behind, holding
her by her arms as a bulwark against our lead.
Black Hoof with a lightning gesture raised his ax
and struck Dale with the flat of it, sending him
crashing to the ground. Almost at the same moment
two devils leaped from the ground and with
their axes struck Granville and his sister from behind.
Black Hoof dropped behind his log the moment
he struck Dale.</p>
<p>Ward remained standing, sheltered by the girl.
But the two who had killed Granville and his sister
forgot us in their lust to secure the scalps. I got
one as he was kneeling on the man, and Cousin shot
the other through the head before he could touch the
woman. I shall never forget the terrible scream
which burst from the lips of Patricia Dale. Then
she went limp and her head sagged over Ward&#8217;s
arms, and he began to walk backward with her to
the forest.</p>
<p>I ran to the door and Cousin stuck out his foot
and tripped me, and my head hit against the logs,
and for a minute confused me beyond the possibility
of action. When I would have renewed my efforts
to pursue and die in attempting the rescue of the girl
Ward was dragging her into the woods. Cousin&#8217;s
arm was around my neck, and as he pulled me back
he passionately cried:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Will it help her to git killed? The ground&#8217;s
alive with &#8217;em! You can&#8217;t more&#8217;n show your head
afore they&#8217;d have your hair!&#8221;</p>
<p>I got to a loophole and looked out. Several guns
banged and the bullets pattered into the logs. There
was no sign of life in the valley beyond this scattering
volley, however. Ward and the girl were
gone. The dead Indian and dog were partly in view
among the weeds beside the lick-block. The gown
of the dead woman made a little patch of melancholy
color against the green of the grass and ranker
ground growth. Granville had been dragged behind
some bushes to be scalped. I came near firing when
I beheld two Shawnees making for the timber.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fellers we potted,&#8221; murmured Cousin. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
hitched cords to &#8217;em an&#8217; are draggin&#8217; &#8217;em to the
woods so&#8217;s no one&#8217;ll git their hair.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the Granville cabin a gun roared loudly;
and an Indian, clawing at his bloody breast, shot up
in the heart of a clump of bushes and pitched forward
on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Lawdy! But the Englisher must &#8217;a&#8217; used &#8217;bout
a pint o&#8217; buckshot!&#8221; exclaimed Cousin admiringly.
&#8220;Pretty smart, too! He traced the cord back to
where th&#8217; Injun was haulin&#8217; on it, an&#8217; trusted to his
medicine to make the spreadin&#8217; buckshot fetch somethin&#8217;.
Wish he had smoothbores an&#8217; a few pounds
o&#8217; shot!&#8221;</p>
<p>Yells of rage and a furious volley against the two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
cabins evidenced how the enemy viewed the Englishman&#8217;s
success. Again the smoothbore roared
and a handful of balls scoured another thicket. A
warrior leaped from cover and started to run to the
woods. Cousin shot him off his feet before he
could make a rod.</p>
<p>Our admiration for the smoothbore and its wholesale
tactics was beyond expression. The Indians,
also, thoroughly appreciated its efficacy, and there
was a general backward movement toward the
woods. No savage showed himself except for a
flash of bronze leg, or the flutter of a hand, too
transient for even Cousin to take advantage of.
The Englishman fired again, but flushed no game.</p>
<p>&#8220;We oughter be goin&#8217;,&#8221; Cousin mused. &#8220;But the
ridge behind us is still alive with &#8217;em. Reckon we
must wait till it gits dark.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till night? Oh, I can&#8217;t do that!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your gal may be skeered to death, but she ain&#8217;t
been hurt any yet,&#8221; he encouraged. &#8220;She&#8217;s safe till
they git her back to the towns. Black Hoof is too
smart to hurt her now. If he gits into a tight corner
afore he reaches the Ohio he&#8217;ll need her to buy an
open path with. She ain&#8217;t in no danger s&#8217;long as
he wants her on hand to swap if the settlers git him
penned.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No danger? And in the hands of that damned
renegade!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa is boss o&#8217; that band. Ward was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
only a spy. They may burn your gal when they git
back on the Scioto where every one can enjoy it.
But she won&#8217;t be hurt any this side o&#8217; the Ohio.
Our first job is to git clear o&#8217; this cabin an&#8217; valley.
Then we must head those dogs off an&#8217; do the next
job right.&#8221;</p>
<p>His words cleared my mind of madness. Instead
of the dark forest, forty rods away, marking the
end of everything, I need not entirely despair until
the girl reached the Scioto.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve hitched a rope to Dale an&#8217; are draggin&#8217;
him to the woods. The damn fool ain&#8217;t dead yet.
Black Hoof fetched him a crack with the flat of his
ax, but they&#8217;ll roast him to a frizzle by &#8217;n&#8217; by if our
medicine don&#8217;t fetch him out of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man had been grossly mistaken and I pitied
him. I wondered what he would think of the influence
of trade on red heathens at war when he
regained his senses! Surely he would learn the
torments of hell when he beheld his daughter a prisoner.</p>
<p>The cabin was like an oven and the sting of
powder-smoke made our eyes water. Outside the
birds were fluttering about their daily tasks. High
among the fleecy cloud-bundles were dark specks
which we knew to be turkey-buzzards, already attracted
by the dead. For some time the only sign
of the enemy&#8217;s presence was when three horses galloped
down the valley, running from the savages in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
the edge of the woods. As the animals drew near
the cabins and showed an inclination to visit the
lick-block a volley from the Indians sent one down.
The other two dashed madly toward the Bluestone.</p>
<p>Cousin studied the ridge back of the cabin and
failed to discover any suggestion of the hidden foe.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which ain&#8217;t no token they ain&#8217;t there,&#8221; he muttered.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they hadn&#8217;t scared the horses we could have
caught a couple!&#8221; I lamented.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;d been shot off their backs afore we&#8217;d gone
two rods,&#8221; assured my companion. &#8220;Let me show
you.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he took a big gourd from the corner
and painted a face on it with a piece of charcoal
found in the fireplace. To a few small wooden
pegs stuck in the top he made fast some long strings
of tow, shredded out to resemble hair. Then he
placed my hat on top of the gourd and the effect
was most grotesque. Yet from a distance it easily
would be mistaken for a human face.</p>
<p>It was a vast improvement on the old trick of
hoisting a hat on a stick. His next maneuver was
to enlarge one of the holes I had made in the roof.
When he thrust his hands through the hole, as if
about to draw himself up, he focused every savage
eye on the back of the cabin roof. Through the
opening he slowly pushed the gourd, topped by the
hat and having long hair hanging down the sides.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span></p>
<p>The decoy was barely in place before he was on
the floor while a volley of lead and a flight of arrows
rained against the roof.</p>
<p>&#8220;I &#8217;low that they&#8217;re still there,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll wait till dark and then rush us.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll use fire-arrers first,&#8221; he corrected. &#8220;The
Hoof has a poor stomick for losin&#8217; more warriors.
He&#8217;ll need lots o&#8217; sculps an&#8217; prisoners to make up
for the men he&#8217;s lost. He&#8217;ll take no more chances.
When it gits dark they&#8217;ll start a blaze on the roof.
They&#8217;ll creep mighty close without our seein&#8217; &#8217;em.
The minute we show ourselves they&#8217;ll be ready to
jump us. The chief is reckonin&#8217; to take us alive.
The towns on the Scioto will need more&#8217;n one stake-fire
to make &#8217;em forgit what this trip to Virginia
has cost &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>The business of waiting was most dreary. There
was no water in the cabin, and the sweat from our
hands would spoil a priming unless care was taken.
At the end of this misery was almost certain captivity,
ended by torture. Cousin had the same
thought for he spoke up and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll live s&#8217;long&#8217;s there&#8217;s any show to even up the
score, but I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; to be kept alive no three days
over a slow fire just to make some fun for them
damn beggars.&#8221;</p>
<p>I watched the bar of sunlight slowly move over
the rough puncheon floor. The time passed infernally
slowly for men waiting to test a hopeless hazard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
By all logic the minutes should have been very
precious and should have fairly flashed into eternity.
The best we could reasonably wish for was death
in combat, or self-inflicted. Yet we cursed the heat,
the buzzing flies, the choking fumes of powder, the
lack of water, and wished the time away.</p>
<p>I wanted to open the door a bit for a breath of
outside air. Cousin objected, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;We could do it, an&#8217; there ain&#8217;t no Injuns near
&#8217;nough to play us any tricks. But they&#8217;d see the
door was open, even if only a crack, and they&#8217;d
know we was gittin&#8217; desperate, or sufferin&#8217; a heap,
an&#8217; that would tickle &#8217;em. I&#8217;m ag&#8217;in&#8217; givin&#8217; &#8217;em
even that bit of enjoyment. If we can make a break
when it gits dark afore the fire-arrers begin lightin&#8217;
things up we&#8217;ll try for the Bluestone. If we could
git clear o&#8217; this damn bottle we&#8217;d stand a chance o&#8217;
makin&#8217; our hosses.&#8221;</p>
<p>I glanced down at the floor, and my heart tightened
a bit. The bar of sunlight had vanished.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve just &#8217;bout come to it,&#8221; gravely remarked
Cousin. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t no talkin&#8217; cuss, but I&#8217;ll say right
here that I sorter like you, Morris. If things could
&#8217;a&#8217; been different, an&#8217; I could be more like other
folks, I &#8217;low we&#8217;d been good friends.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re the best of friends, Shelby. As long as
I can think I shall remember how you came with me
into this trap to help rescue the girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shucks! Don&#8217;t be a fool!&#8221; he growled. &#8220;That
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span>
ain&#8217;t nothin&#8217;. Once I bu&#8217;sted up a Mingo camp to
git my dawg. They&#8217;d caught the critter an&#8217; was
cal&#8217;latin&#8217; to sculp him alive. Got him free, too,
an&#8217; the damn pup was that stirred up by his
feelin&#8217;s that he couldn&#8217;t tell who was his friends, an&#8217;
he chawed my thumb somethin&#8217; cruel.&#8221;</p>
<p>He stepped to the loophole, and after peering out
mumbled:</p>
<p>&#8220;Changin&#8217; mighty smart.&#8221;</p>
<p>I glanced out and the ridges were losing their outlines
and the valley was becoming blurred. Cousin
mused.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll be comin&#8217; right smart now. Don&#8217;t overlook
anything.&#8221;</p>
<p>We made a last examination of flints and primings,
and Cousin softly arranged the heavy door
bar so it might be displaced with a single movement.
He startled me by abruptly standing erect
and cocking his head to one side and remaining motionless.</p>
<p>&#8220;The old Englishman!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;He ain&#8217;t
fired a shot, or tried to talk with us for a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>I went to the front end of the cabin and put my
eye to the peephole. The small window showed
black. I called to him several times and received
no answer. There was only one conclusion. A
chance ball through a loophole or a window had
killed the old fellow. Cousin agreed to this. A
signal at the mouth of the valley brought us to our
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
toes. It was about to begin. The signal was
answered from the ridge behind us.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve put the stopper in the bottle,&#8221; Cousin
whispered. &#8220;But here&#8217;s an idea. The upper cabin,
where the Dales was, is empty. If we could sneak in
there without bein&#8217; seen we&#8217;d have the slimmest sort
of a chance to duck back to the ridge while they
was shootin&#8217; their fire-arrers at this cabin. There
would be a few minutes, when the first flames begin
showin&#8217;, when every eye would be on this place. If
we could only reach the flank o&#8217; the ridge we&#8217;d be
fools if we couldn&#8217;t dodge &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>
<p>This appealed to me as being excellent strategy.
Knowing the Dales&#8217; cabin was empty, the Indians
would not think of paying it much attention at first.
To leave our shelter and make the short distance
would require darkness. Our greatest danger
would be from the Indians on the ridge back of us.
By this time they were lined up at the foot of the
slope and were all ready to break from cover.</p>
<p>In our favor was the Granville cabin, which would
shelter us from the ridge for a bit of the perilous
way. Already it was possible, I decided, to crawl
the distance without being detected by the enemy
across the valley. Cousin refused to run the risk,
and argued.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every minute gained now gives us that much
more of a chance. The Injuns out front ain&#8217;t all
across the valley any more. They begun creepin&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
into the clearin&#8217; the minute it begun growin&#8217; dark.
Reckon it&#8217;s time they l&#8217;arned who&#8217;s cooped up in
here, so&#8217;s they won&#8217;t git too bold.&#8221;</p>
<p>He removed the bar of the door and through the
crevice sounded his terrible war-cry, the scream of
a panther. It stabbed the dusk with ear-splitting
intensity.</p>
<p>&#8220;There! They&#8217;ll stop an&#8217; count a dozen afore
gittin&#8217; too close,&#8221; he muttered as he softly replaced
the bar. &#8220;They&#8217;ll lay mighty low an&#8217; won&#8217;t bother
to do much but watch the door. I &#8217;low it&#8217;ll be hard
work to crawl out without they guessin&#8217; somethin&#8217;s
wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s rip up the floor and dig a hole under
the logs,&#8221; I suggested.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll do that,&#8221; he quietly agreed.</p>
<p>As cautiously as possible we removed several of
the puncheon slabs next to the wall. The base logs
were huge fellows and held the floor several feet
from the ground. To excavate a hole under either
of the four would have required more time than we
believed we had to spare. Our plan threatened to
be hopeless until Cousin explored the length of the
log with his fingers and gave a little cry of delight.
He found a hole already dug near the front end of
the cabin. It had been the work of the dog. Working
with our hunting-knives we loosened the dirt
and pawed it behind us and made it larger. At last
Cousin pressed me back and ducked his head and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
shoulders into the hole. Then he drew back and
whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I can git my head an&#8217; shoulders through. &#8217;low
I could squirm out o&#8217; hell if I could git my shoulders
through. I&#8217;ll go ahead an&#8217; you pass out the rifles.
Ready?&#8221;</p>
<p>I pressed his hand. There followed a few moments
of waiting, then a handful of dirt fell into the
hole and informed me my companion had squeezed
clear of the log and that the ultimate test was to be
faced. I passed the rifles, butts first, and felt them
gently removed from my grasp. Working noiselessly
as possible I soon squirmed out into the refreshing
evening air and lay motionless. Cousin
was ahead and already worming his way toward
the third cabin. My outstretched hand touched the
butt of my rifle, and I began creeping after my
friend.</p>
<p>I nearly suffocated in crawling by the opening
between our cabin and the Granville cabin, for I
scarcely ventured to breathe. It seemed as if any
one within pistol-shot of me must hear the pounding
of my heart. The silence continued, and at last
I was hugging the ground at the end of the cabin
and for the time sheltered from spying eyes at the
foot of the ridge.</p>
<p>A quavering cry rang out at the mouth of the
valley. This time it was answered from the clearing
on our right as well as from the ridge. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span>
Indians had crept closer, just as Cousin had predicted.</p>
<p>Half a minute passed, then the signal sounded
directly ahead of us, or from beyond the Dales&#8217;
cabin. The circle was completed. From the ridge
soared a burning arrow. It fell short, landing behind
the cabin we had vacated. As it gave off no
light I surmised it went out on striking the ground.</p>
<p>Cousin drew away from the end of the Granville
cabin and was risking the second and last gap. I
hurried a bit, fearing more arrows. As I came
abreast of the door I wondered what had become of
the Englishman. Either the night was playing a
trick, or else the door was partly open. I reached
out my hand to learn the truth, and touched a cold
hand hanging limply over the threshold.</p>
<p>My nerves jumped, but I mastered them by
reasoning that the Englishman had been shot by a
chance ball and had attempted to leave the cabin,
thinking to gain our shelter and to die there. Death
had overtaken him as he was opening the door.
That it was the Englishman&#8217;s hand I had touched
was evidenced by the shirt-sleeve, puckered in at
the wrist.</p>
<p>I released the poor hand and was resuming my
way when a slight sound caused me to hold my
breath. Then a heavy weight landed on my back,
knocking the breath from my lungs with an explosive
grunt. Next, the night was ripped from horizon
to horizon with a jagged streak of red.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>DALE ESCAPES</h3>
</div>

<p>When I recovered my senses I was being
dragged over the ground by means of a cord
around my chest and under my arms. My wrists
were lashed together and my ankles were likewise
secured. The first thing my eyes beheld were the
red loopholes and window of the lower cabin, and
the flames crawling through the two holes I had
made in the roof.</p>
<p>My capture had revealed our desertion of the
cabin, and the Indians had lost no time in entering
and firing it. Smoke and flames were pouring
from the end window of the Granville cabin also.
As the red tongues licked across the top of the
doorway they threw into relief the arm and hand of
the old Englishman still hanging over the threshold.</p>
<p>My head felt as though it was cracked wide open
and it throbbed most sickeningly. I managed to
lift it a bit to escape further bruises as my captor
roughly hauled me to the forest. The third cabin,
the one occupied by the Dales, burst into flames as
I was being yanked into the first fringe of bushes.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
The valley was now brightly lighted, and my last
view of it included the lick-block. One phase of a
successful Indian raid was missing; there were no
warriors madly dancing about the burning homes.
Far up the ridge rang out the infuriated cry of a
panther, and I knew it was fear of young Cousin&#8217;s
deadly rifle that was keeping the savages under
cover.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me stand up and walk,&#8221; I said in Shawnee.</p>
<p>&#8220;Alive are you?&#8221; growled a white man&#8217;s voice in
English.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be John Ward,&#8221; I said as some one lifted
me to my feet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am Red Arrow, a Shawnee. And don&#8217;t you
forget it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where are the Dales?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep your mouth shut!&#8221; he ordered.</p>
<p>They untied my hands only to fasten them behind
me. They shifted the waist-cord to my neck, and
then released my feet. Some one walked ahead,
pulling on the cord, and I followed as best I could
to escape being strangled. On each side of me
walked a warrior, invisible except as when we
crossed a glade where the starlight filtered down.
Ward walked behind me, and warned:</p>
<p>&#8220;Any tricks and you&#8217;ll get my ax.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You were in the cabin with the dead Englishman?&#8221;</p>
<p>He chuckled softly and boasted:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I killed him. When you two were fighting
fire I got my chance to steal down to the Dale cabin.
Then it was easy to make the Granville cabin. The
old fool thought I was one of you when he heard
my voice, and drew the bar. I was inside and had
his life before he knew he had made a mistake. I
waited. Then you crawled along. Curse that
damned young devil who yells like a panther! He
was the one I wanted. I&#8217;d give a thousand of such
as you to get his hair! But he got by the door
without my hearing him. A little more, and you&#8217;d
have passed, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was much crashing and running through
the bushes behind us, and occasionally I could make
out dark shapes hurrying by. These were the warriors
who had fired the cabins, and now they were
in haste to leave the spot. Owing to their fear of
Cousin they dared not leave the valley except as they
did so under cover. We made good time through
the woods, however, although more than once my
gasping cry warned Ward, or one of the savages at
my side, that I was being choked to death.</p>
<p>As a premature demise was not on their program
the cord was quickly loosened each time, and the
man ahead warned to be more careful. These partial
strangulations resulted from the fellow&#8217;s anxiety
to escape from the neighborhood of the double-barrel
rifle. On reaching the Bluestone we halted
while the savages collected their horses. From the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
few words exchanged I estimated that half the band
was mounted. Without building a fire or eating
we started up the Bluestone. Neither Black Hoof
nor the Dales were with our party when we halted
at daybreak. We paused only long enough to bolt
some half-cooked deer-meat. I asked for the trader
and his daughter, and Ward laughed and shook
before my face the scalps he had taken in the Granville
cabin. Two of them were pitiably small.</p>
<p>&#8220;You scalp other men&#8217;s kills,&#8221; I observed.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll not say that when I scalp you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Dale now think of his Indian
friends?&#8221;</p>
<p>This seemed to amuse him tremendously, and he
laughed like a white man.</p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t seem to know what has happened,&#8221;
he finally replied with much relish. &#8220;He stares at
us, then at the girl, as if trying to understand.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What about the girl?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s enough. Keep still,&#8221; he warned, and
made a threatening gesture with his ax.</p>
<p>My hands, which had been released long enough
for me to eat, were trussed up again. My rough
usage and the travel had worn on me, but I had no
desire to rest so long as Patricia Dale was to be
found. My captors also had a definite plan&mdash;one
that demanded haste. By daylight I perceived by
the signs that the greater number of the band had
gone ahead, probably under the lead of Black Hoof.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>Unless the Dales had been butchered in the woods
they must be with the chief; and I could not believe
they were dead. They would be too valuable as
hostages should the settlers gather in force to block
the Shawnees&#8217; return to the Ohio. Those of the
Indians who had horses, with the exception of two,
rode off. One of the mounted men to remain was
Ward, who came behind me. The other was the
Indian holding the cord.</p>
<p>It was plain that every savage in the band was
eager to advance with all possible haste, nor was it
fear of Cousin that was now driving them. Finally
my aching head understood it all; the Howard&#8217;s
Creek settlement was to be attacked and the savages
afoot were afraid they would arrive too late
to participate.</p>
<p>On our left rose the wall of Great Flat Top Mountain,
a short chain, in reality a continuation of Tug
Ridge. On the right rose ridge after ridge of the
Alleghanies, punctuated by Peter&#8217;s Mountain, where
New River burst through the wall in its quest for
the Ohio. A wild land, and yet birds, bees and deer
were here, and the soil was ripe for happy homes.</p>
<p>I managed to keep up until after midday, when
my legs suddenly refused to carry me farther. I
told Ward to tomahawk me if he wished, but that
I must rest before moving another step. There was
no question as to his inclination, for his brown hand
fondled his ax most longingly. He dismounted and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
boosted me on to his horse. The rest of the day was
covered with me riding first Ward&#8217;s and then the
savage&#8217;s animal.</p>
<p>We camped at dusk that night, and I was too
exhausted to swallow more than a few mouthfuls of
food before falling asleep. Before sunrise we were
up and hurrying through the gray mists and reversing
the route Cousin and I had followed on traveling
to the valley. I recognized several of the camps
where the Dales and Ward had halted when the
brute was leading them into the death-trap.</p>
<p>&#8220;You nearly got me by dropping the girl&#8217;s moccasin
in the mountains,&#8221; I informed him.</p>
<p>The abruptness of the accusation took him off his
guard. With a wide grin he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Stole it from her just before we entered the settlement.
Saw Hughes striking into the hills and
planned to catch him. But he got too far ahead for
me to ride around him. Dogged him until he met
you, then rode back and laid my trap. Hughes was
the man I was after. His hair would count for a
dozen scalps like yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But you didn&#8217;t care to try a shot unless it could
be from behind and sure to kill,&#8221; I taunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll pay a high price for that,&#8221; he quietly assured
me. &#8220;The chief says you are to be brought in
alive. We will soon see how brave you are with the
girl looking on. Men should be very brave men
when their squaws are watching.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span></p>
<p>I was afoot and walking at his side. I lowered
my head and tried to butt him from the saddle. He
kicked me in the chest and the warrior yanked on
the cord and threw me down on my face and all but
strangled me. After that Ward and I had no more
words. He rode either ahead, or some distance
behind, leaving one of the Indians to walk at my
heels. I have no doubt he did this to avoid any
temptation to brain me. I lost track of time, for we
traveled far into the night when the footing was
good. We snatched a few hours&#8217; sleep when absolutely
necessary and fed indifferently. When I
could walk no farther I was placed on one of the
two horses. I hoped that Cousin in escaping from
Abb&#8217;s Valley had taken our horses with him; and
I prayed he would reach Howard&#8217;s Creek ahead of
Black Hoof.</p>
<p>At last we came to the outskirts of an Indian
camp, which I estimated to be within less than half a
mile of the creek settlement. A dozen warriors
swarmed forward to greet us, welcoming me with
exaggerated courtesy. While they were thus mocking
me Black Hoof appeared, moving with great
dignity, and dispersing my tormentors with a gesture.</p>
<p>I was led into the camp and my cord made fast
to a tree. There was no air of triumph about the
place. A warrior reclining on a pile of boughs and
nursing a shattered shoulder suggested a futile attack
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
on the cabins. I glanced about for a display
of fresh scalps and rejoiced at beholding none.</p>
<p>The Indians stared at me malevolently, but offered
me no abuse. Ward proudly flourished the
hair he had retrieved from the Granville cabin, and
the trophies were soon fastened to a tall pole and
paraded around the camp, after which demonstration
the pole was stuck upright in the ground.</p>
<p>It required a second examination of the place to
locate Dale. Like myself he was tied to a tree with
sufficient length of cord to permit him to lie down.
His face was heavy with unspeakable horror. When
he met my gaze he did not seem to recognize me at
first. Then he muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;You, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>My heart ached when I failed to discover any
trace of Patricia. Before I could question the trader,
Ward yanked me to my feet and turned me about,
and I found myself looking into the eyes of Black
Hoof.</p>
<p>&#8220;The young man made a very brave fight,&#8221; he
said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is sad to know a skunk and not a Shawnee
warrior captured me,&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>Ward glared murder at me. Black Hoof gave
him a warning glance, and informed me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Red Arrow is a Shawnee warrior. Very brave.
Very cunning. He will help us take the cabins on
the creek.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have tried once?&#8221; I asked, glancing at the
man with the broken shoulder.</p>
<p>The chief&#8217;s brows contracted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some of my young men were very foolish,&#8221; he
replied. &#8220;When Catahecassa tries, the first time
will be the last.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the direction of the settlement came the
scream of a panther, and at the sound the camp
seemed to stir uneasily. With a fiery glance at
the warriors Black Hoof gave an order, and a score
of men glided into the forest. To me he quietly
said:</p>
<p>&#8220;There was a panther&#8217;s whelp in the little valley
we did not get. The Shawnees would dance his
scalp ahead of all the hair growing in any of these
valleys. He rode to the settlement ahead of me.
But we shall get them now. We shall get him.
Then we will see if his war-cry is strong when he
feels fire.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where is the white woman? Did you kill her?&#8221;
I asked, and I had to fight myself to keep my voice
from shaking.</p>
<p>Without deigning to answer he turned and walked
over to Dale. At almost the same moment Patricia
and Shelby Cousin&#8217;s sister entered the camp. Patricia
walked ahead, the Cousin girl a few feet behind
her. I forgot the cord and eagerly started to
join her.</p>
<p>Ward snarled like an animal and jerked on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
cord and pulled me violently back. Patricia glanced
in our direction, and I saw her hand fly to her heart
as she stared at me with lips parted. Black Hoof
noticed this bit of drama, and wheeling about, he
harshly commanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Let Red Arrow remember I am chief. If the
white man would talk to the white woman do not
stop him. See that his hands are well tied and put
hobbles on his legs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I had my way with you!&#8221; hissed Ward.</p>
<p>An Indian slipped the cord from the tree and with
it trailing behind me I hurried to the girl. She
dropped on a log, her face a white mask of terror.
Cousin&#8217;s sister remained a few paces behind her.
Her face was expressionless, but she did not remove
her gaze from Patricia. Perhaps Patsy was the
first white woman she had seen whose freshness
suggested her own youth. Recognizing my desire
to talk with the prisoner she withdrew, keeping in
sight but out of hearing.</p>
<p>&#8220;At least they have not tied you,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I go and come as I will,&#8221; was the listless answer.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the woman to watch you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not if I want to be alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You mean you are free to go and come
unwatched?&#8221; I demanded.</p>
<p>She nodded her head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then why haven&#8217;t you tried to make the settlement?
It is near. Listen. Shelby Cousin is here.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
The Indians can&#8217;t afford the time it will take to capture
the place. Walk along into the woods. Go
due east. By God&#8217;s grace I believe you can make
it!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Basdel, you forget,&#8221; she sorrowfully reproached.
&#8220;You forget my father is here. That is why they
give me my freedom.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He would rejoice and thank God if you would
do as I say.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Indian woman with the blue eyes has
told me in English that if I run away they will hurt
him terribly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Poor child! As if her presence could save Ericus
Dale from dying the death once Black Hoof found
time to indulge in his favorite pastime. I vehemently
begged her to flee, promising all sorts of
absurd things if she would but do so, even to assuring
her I would effect her father&#8217;s release.</p>
<p>She slowly shook her head, tempted not the least
by my pleas.</p>
<p>&#8220;Even the Indians know me better than that.
And to think we trusted them! Oh, Basdel, it
doesn&#8217;t seem possible! You were right. Father
was wrong. God help him! And now they have
taken you!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All will be well yet,&#8221; I faltered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, all will be well,&#8221; she gently said. &#8220;All will
be well, when we are dead and at peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patsy! Patsy!&#8221; I begged. &#8220;Don&#8217;t give up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
hope. Don&#8217;t lose your courage! Why, there&#8217;s a
dozen chances for us to fool these devils.&#8221;</p>
<p>She patted my tied hands, and murmured:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a good boy, Basdel. You were patient
when I abused you. You told me the truth. I am
out of place out here. If I were a pioneer woman
I could help you plan to escape, but I am only a silly
fool from over the mountains. I am absolutely
helpless. But you&#8217;ve been good to me, Basdel. You
followed me into that horrible valley. You were
caught because you tried to help us. Oh, the shame
of it! The hideous cruelty of it! That you were
caught&mdash;Basdel, I pray my last thought will be
about your goodness to me. Just that.&#8221;</p>
<p>She was at the limit of her endurance and I
backed away and Cousin&#8217;s sister glided forward. I
flogged my mind for a scheme of escape which
would include her; her father, if possible. But it
was as she had said; she was no pioneer woman,
resourceful and daring. The Shawnees saw her
helplessness, else they never would have allowed her
the freedom of the camp and surrounding woods.</p>
<p>They knew she would never leave her father, and
that she lacked the border woman&#8217;s daring initiative
so necessary in any attempt to free him. As I was
casting about for some plan to save her Black Hoof
glided to my side and took me by the arm and led
me toward the tree where Dale was lying.</p>
<p>This closer inspection of the trader revealed how
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
fearfully he had suffered in his mind. The flesh of
his strong face hung in folds as if his skin had suddenly
become many sizes too large for him. His
eyes had retreated deeper into the sockets, and his
thick lips, once so firm and domineering, were loose
and flabby. Black Hoof stirred him contemptuously
with his foot. Dale dragged himself to a sitting posture
and began shivering as if suffering from ague.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my God, Morris!&#8221; he groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pack-Horse-Man can save his life,&#8221; sententiously
began Black Hoof.</p>
<p>&#8220;My daughter?&#8221; gasped Dale, rising on his knees.</p>
<p>&#8220;He shall save his daughter&#8217;s life,&#8221; added the
chief.</p>
<p>Dale moistened his lips and tried to recover some
of his old spirit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, Morris. Give me a little time. I&#8217;ll
get us all out of this fix. They&#8217;re angry now. When
they&#8217;ve had time to think they&#8217;ll be reasonable. If
they kill me, they&#8217;ll kill their trade with the whites.&#8221;
It was the first time I ever heard him pronounce the
word without stressing it.</p>
<p>Black Hoof glowered at the miserable man ferociously
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You will go to the edge of the clearing with my
warriors. You will speak to the settlers and tell
them they shall save their lives if they put down
their guns. After they put down their guns you and
your daughter shall go free.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>The picture of Abb&#8217;s Valley and the result of his
trusting in the Shawnees&#8217; promises must have
flashed across the unhappy man&#8217;s mind. He sank,
feebly moaning:</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no! Not that! The blood of the Granvilles&mdash;the
little children&mdash;is on me. Kill me, but I&#8217;ll
lead no more into your trap.&#8221;</p>
<p>These were brave words even if brokenly voiced.
But Black Hoof heard with grim amusement in his
small black eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;You weak-hearted dog!&#8221; he hissed. &#8220;So you tell
Catahecassa what he will and what he will not, do.
Ho! You fat white man who always planned to
cheat the Indians in a trade. You fill your ears
against Catahecassa&#8217;s words? Ho! Then you are
a brave man. The Shawnees have been blind not to
see your brave heart. Now, white trader, hear my
talk. You will do as Catahecassa says, or you will
be tied to a tree and your daughter shall be put to
the torture before your eyes.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a terrible cry Dale fell over on his side and
remained unconscious. There was a second shriek,
and the girl was pushing Black Hoof aside as she
hastened to kneel by her father. The chief darted
a glance of admiration at her for her display of
courage. The girl was blind to our presence as
she fondled and petted the stricken man until he
opened his eyes. Black Hoof was pleased to have
her there as a means of breaking down the trader&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
will. Leaning over her shoulder to stare down into
the terrified eyes of his victim the chief warned:</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless the settlers give themselves up it shall be
as I have said. It must be before the sun goes
down. Tell her all I have said.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he dragged me back to my tree. For
a few minutes the chief&#8217;s horrible threat dulled my
mind to the point of stupidity. He waited for me to
collect my thoughts. At last I managed to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;What you said back there was a trick of course?
You would never torture the daughter of the Pack-Horse-Man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unless he does as told she must die,&#8221; he calmly
assured me. &#8220;She will die soon anyway. She is
not strong enough to live our life, like the blue-eyed
squaw over there.&#8221; And he glanced toward
Cousin&#8217;s sister. &#8220;Her children would be neither
red nor white. They would have squaw-hearts. If
the trader does not speak words that will bring the
settlers from their cabins with empty hands she shall
be tortured until he does speak.&#8221;</p>
<p>I do not remember falling, yet I found myself on
the ground, and Black Hoof had departed. In his
place stood Ward, staring at me curiously.</p>
<p>&#8220;You went down as if hit with an ax,&#8221; he
grunted.</p>
<p>&#8220;My legs are weak from hard travel and poor
food,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>Patricia Dale passed quite close to us, a gourd of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
water in her hands. She was carrying it to her
father. Ward exclaimed in English:</p>
<p>&#8220;What a woman!&#8221;</p>
<p>His brawny figure seemed to dilate and he made a
queer hissing noise as he looked after her. Turning
to me he hoarsely said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I was born white. It&#8217;s her blood that calls me.
When I saw her in Salem I said I would have her
for my squaw if I could get her and her fool of a
father into the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>My mental paralysis lifted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she promised to you?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to have any two prisoners to do with as I
like,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;Catahecassa said that when
I started to enter the villages beyond the mountains
to get news. There was little chance of bringing
any whites back, but if I did I was to have two of
them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you had better remind your chief of his
promise,&#8221; I warned. &#8220;He says he will torture the
girl before her father&#8217;s eyes if the father does not
help in betraying the settlers.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Ugh! I have his promise. He dare not break
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl would kill herself before submitting to
Ward&#8217;s savage caresses. She would go mad if
forced to witness the torture of her father. I had
seized upon Ward&#8217;s passion as a means of gaining
a bit more time. If he could successfully claim the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
girl then she must be rescued from him. But
viewed from any angle I could find nothing but
horrors.</p>
<p>Release by death would be very kind. If any
harm were suffered by the girl I should lose my
reason; my life, if God were merciful. No longer
did our time of grace extend to the Scioto villages.
At any moment our little destinies might come to a
fearful ending. In my soul I railed at the curse of
it. Such a little way to go, and so much pain and
sorrow.</p>
<p>Ward left me and strode up to the chief. They
talked rapidly, and I could read from Ward&#8217;s mien
that he was very angry. When he returned to me
he was in a rare rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa dodges by saying you and the trader
are the two prisoners I must take. He says he will
burn the girl unless the trader makes the talk as
told. If I can find a way of capturing the settlers
the girl will be given to me in place of either you
or her father.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to be your prisoner,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe you do,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;But I
would take you if I did not need the trader. If the
girl refuses to become my squaw then I will build a
little fire on Dale&#8217;s back. That will make her accept
my belts.&#8221;</p>
<p>He left me with that thought in my mind. On
the one hand the girl was to be utilized in forcing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
Dale to betray the settlement. On the other, the
trader was to be used to make the girl submit to the
renegade. I could not imagine a more horrible situation.
I was still wallowing deep in my hell when
the camp became very active. Dale was lifted to his
feet and his cords were removed.</p>
<p>The time had come for Black Hoof to try him as
a decoy. There remained a good hour of light.
Patricia, not understanding, yet fearing the worst,
hovered about her father, her eyes wildly staring
and her whole appearance denoting a weakening of
her reason. As they started to lead her father into
the woods she attempted to follow him, and Black
Hoof pushed her back. Cousin&#8217;s sister spoke up,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;I will keep her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The warriors disappeared in the direction of the
settlement. The two women left the camp on the
opposite side. Ward went along with the Indians,
and I knew this was my golden opportunity to
escape. Before I could make a beginning at freeing
my hands a noose fell over my head and clutched
at my throat. The guards were taking no chances.</p>
<p>Great mental anguish is accompanied by no clarity
of thought and graves no connected memories on
the mind. I know I suffered, but there are only
fragments of recollections covering that black period
of waiting.</p>
<p>I have a clear picture of the warrior holding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
end of the cord calling for some one to bring a
gourd of water. I do not remember drinking, but
as later I found the front of my shirt soaked I assume
the water was for me. Coherent memory
resumes with the noise the warriors made in returning
to the camp. I shall never forget their appearance
as they emerged from the undergrowth. Black
Hoof walked ahead. Close behind him came two
warriors dragging Dale.</p>
<p>I was amazed to behold Patricia in the procession.
She was leaning on Lost Sister&#8217;s arm, and
there was a lump on her forehead as though she had
been struck most brutally. Then came the warriors
and Ward. Dale was roughly thrown to the
ground. Several men began trimming the branches
from a stout sapling. Others became busy searching
the fallen timber for dry wood.</p>
<p>Ward walked over to me and kicked me in the
side. I must have groaned aloud, for he commanded:</p>
<p>&#8220;Shut up! I&#8217;m ripe for a killing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matters had gone against his liking. He played
with his ax nervously, his baleful gaze darting about
the camp. I waited and at last his race heritage
compelled him to talk, and he commenced:</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man was scared into doing what the
chief told him to do. He would not at first, and
the men were sent to bring the girl along. When
he faced her he made a noise like a sheep bleating.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248' name='page_248'></a>248</span>
Then he ran to the clearing and began his talk.
The girl heard his words. She broke away and
ran into sight of the cabins and screamed for them
not to listen, that it was a trap. Black Hoof struck
her with the flat of his ax. Now he swears he&#8217;ll
roast the fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is your prisoner!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;He says she must burn.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There must be some way, something you can
do!&#8221; I wildly insisted, my only thought being to
spare her the immediate danger.</p>
<p>&#8220;I want her for my squaw bad enough to get her
if I can,&#8221; he growled. &#8220;But if I&#8217;m to think of any
plan I must be quick. They&#8217;ve got the stake nearly
ready.&#8221;</p>
<p>He walked to where the warriors were collecting
small fuel from between the fallen trees. One of
them hauled a hollow maple log out of the débris
and threw it to one side as being too heavy for a
quick fire. Ward halted and rested a foot on it and
bowed his head. Next he began tapping it with his
tomahawk. His actions attracted the attention of
the men, and Black Hoof asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;What does Red Arrow think is in the log? A
snake?&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward startled the savages, and also me, by curtly
replying:</p>
<p>&#8220;He sees a white man&#8217;s cannon in the log. The
fort holds all the settlers on the creek. Its walls are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
stout. If they can be broken down the Shawnees
will take many scalps and prisoners. It will be an
easy victory. Black Hoof&#8217;s name will be repeated
far beyond Kaskaskia and the Great Lakes in the
North. He will be given many new war-names.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Hoof&#8217;s eyes glittered as he pictured the
glory and prestige the hollow log might confer upon
him. He examined the log carefully and perceived
only that it was hollow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you medicine to make it into a cannon?&#8221;
he asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have big medicine. Before it will work for
me I must be given the white squaw. There must
be no taking back of the gift. If the medicine-cannon
does not give the settlers into our hands still the
white squaw must be mine to do with as I will.&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Hoof took some minutes to ponder over
this proposition. He could only see a hollow log.
Ward&#8217;s intellect permitted him to see greater possibilities.
While he waited for the chief to make a
decision he examined the maple more thoroughly,
and smiled quietly.</p>
<p>Black Hoof at last said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa gives the white woman to the Red
Arrow. Tell your medicine to make the big gun
shoot.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward was exultant. To the wondering savages
he explained:</p>
<p>&#8220;It must be bound tight with much rawhide.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
Small stones must be packed tight in the butt-end.
I will make a hole for the priming. Then we will
draw it to the clearing and load it with powder and
rocks.&#8221;</p>
<p>This simple expedient, superior to the best plans
of the Indians, was greeted with yells of triumph.
The chief said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Red Arrow is a medicine-man.&#8221;</p>
<p>The wooden tube was reinforced under Ward&#8217;s
directions. This done, the savages danced and
whooped about the grotesque cannon for some minutes.
Ward stood with folded arms, his gaze gloating
as it rested on the girl, and haughty with pride
as he observed Black Hoof&#8217;s respectful bearing.
Coming back to me he said:</p>
<p>&#8220;You wanted that woman. You will die among
the Shawnees. You showed you wanted her when
you followed her into that valley. Her father spoke
of you and by his words I knew you wanted her.
Now I have her.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl came forward, attracted by Ward&#8217;s
speech to me, although she could understand none of
it. She drew aside in passing the renegade and
dropped on her knees at my side.</p>
<p>&#8220;What do they plan? What will they do with
me?&#8221; her dry lips demanded.</p>
<p>Ward, enraged by her show of aversion, seized
her by the shoulder, ripping the cloth, and dragged
her to her feet, and informed her:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa ordered his men to burn you. I
made him give you to me. You are my woman.
You are lucky I am not a red man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! No! I&#8217;ll burn, you monster! I&#8217;ll burn a
hundred times,&#8221; she panted. And she struck her
hand into his face, whereat the savages shouted in
merriment.</p>
<p>I believed he would kill her then and there, for
he groaned aloud from rage and raised his ax over
his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;Strike me!&#8221; she begged, facing the uplifted ax
unflinchingly; and although not of the border she
displayed the fine courage of the Widow McCabe
and other frontier women.</p>
<p>With a whimpering, bestial note Ward managed
to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;No! You shall live, and many times beg me to
kill you. But you shall still live till I trade you to
some red hunter.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I will kill myself some way before you can harm
me!&#8221; she defied.</p>
<p>Ward slowly lowered his ax and began chuckling.
He told her, pointing to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;This man. He loved you. He was a fool. I
say was because his life is behind him. It is something
that is finished, a trace followed to the end.
He is a dead man as he lies there. He loved you. I
believe you loved him. He is my prisoner. Now you
can guess why I know you will not harm yourself.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span></p>
<p>I knew. She was suffering too much to reason
clearly. But he was eager to help her to understand
He amplified by explaining:</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be for you to say if he is to be tortured.
He is young and strong. We could keep him alive
many days after the fire began to burn him. It will
be a fine game to see whom you love the better,
yourself or him. You will be free to go about the
camp. But this man will be watched all the time.
After we take the fort to-night you will come to me
and ask to be my woman.</p>
<p>&#8220;I had planned to take your father for my second
prisoner. My medicine tells me to take this man as
he will live longer. Remember; you will ask to be
my squaw. That sapling was trimmed for you; it
will do for this man. You will come to me, or he
goes to the stake. Now, go!&#8221;</p>
<p>And he reached out his hand and sent her spinning
and reeling toward her father.</p>
<p>&#8220;You dog! Set me free, empty-handed, and you
take a knife and ax, and I will show the Shawnees
what a poor dog you are,&#8221; I told him in Shawnee.</p>
<p>But he was not to be tempted into any violence
just now. He mocked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You are something to be watched and guarded.
When my new wife is ugly to me I will order you
to the fire. Then she will be kind and you will be
kept alive. Some time you will go to the fire.
When I get tired of her and wish a new wife.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>Patricia crawled to her father and laid her head
on his breast. No one gave her any heed except as
the Cousin girl walked by her several times, watching
her with inscrutable eyes. The Shawnees were
impatient to try their new cannon.</p>
<p>At Ward&#8217;s suggestion Black Hoof sent some of
his warriors to make a feint on the east side of the
fort, so that the cannon could be hurried forward
and mounted across a log while the garrison&#8217;s attention
was distracted. It was now dusk in the woods
although the birds circling high above the glade
caught the sunlight on their wings. The clearing
would now be in the first twilight shadows, and
Black Hoof gave his final orders.</p>
<p>Acting on Ward&#8217;s command two warriors fell
upon me and fastened cords to my wrists and ankles
and staked me out in spread-eagle style, and then
sat beside me, one on each side. Half a dozen of
the older men remained in the camp. Dale was
mumbling something to the girl and she rose as if
at his bidding.</p>
<p>The Cousin girl glided forward and in English
asked what she wanted. It was Dale who told her,
asking for water in Shawnee. She motioned for
Patricia to remain where she was and in a few
minutes brought water in a gourd, and some venison.
Patricia drank but would eat nothing.</p>
<p>The Cousin woman tried to feed Dale, and succeeded
but poorly. I asked for food and water, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
one of them brought a gourd and some meat. They
lifted my head so I might drink and fed me strips
of smoked meat, but they would not release my
hands.</p>
<p>After a time we heard much shouting and the firing
of many guns. This would be the mock attack,
I judged. It increased in volume, this firing, until
I feared that what had been started as a feint was
being pushed forward to a victory.</p>
<p>Suddenly the firing dropped away and only the
yelling continued. This would mean the savages
had succeeded in rushing their wooden cannon close
enough to do damage.</p>
<p>Every Indian left in the camp, including my two
guards, were now standing listening eagerly for the
voice of the cannon. It came, a loud explosion that
dwarfed all rifle-fire any of us had ever heard.
With screams of joy the guard began dancing about
me and the older men danced around the Dales.
They went through all the grotesque attitudes and
steps which they use in their pantomimes of great
victories.</p>
<p>This savage play was quickly stilled, however, as
groans of pain and shouts of furious anger came to
us. Now the cheering was that of white voices only.
There was the noise of many feet hurrying back to
the camp. Black Hoof came through the bushes
first, and only the dusk saved my head from being
split, as with a howl he threw his ax at me. Then
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
came Ward, staggering like a drunken man and
clawing at his left shoulder.</p>
<p>The full force of the catastrophe was revealed
when four broken forms of dead warriors were hurried
into the little opening, followed by a dozen
braves bearing wounds, which would appall a town-dweller.
Ward&#8217;s medicine had lied to them. The
cannon had burst and had scattered its charge of
stones among the Shawnees. One of the corpses
had been beheaded by a piece of rock.</p>
<p>Several warriors rushed toward the Dales; others
ran to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; roared Black Hoof. &#8220;Do not touch the
prisoners!&#8221;</p>
<p>Some one lighted a fire. Other fires sprang up
until the glade was well illumined. Black Hoof sent
some of the younger men to scout the creek so the
camp might not be surprised by a sally. To the
warriors remaining the chief announced:</p>
<p>&#8220;We must march for the Ohio. Bad medicine has
dogged us for many sleeps. I will make a feast to
my medicine and will tell you what it says shall be
done with the prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That man and that woman are my prisoners!&#8221;
hoarsely cried Ward.</p>
<p>&#8220;They were your prisoners while we believed your
medicine was strong. Now that we know your
medicine is weak and foolish they belong to all the
Shawnees. Red Arrow&#8217;s medicine is bad at heart.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
It told him to make a big gun. Four of my warriors
are dead. Many are hurt. It will take blood
to cover the bodies of the dead. Red Arrow has
no prisoners until he goes and catches them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward pulled his ax and limped toward me. No
warrior made an effort to stop him. But Black
Hoof reminded:</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Red Arrow is no longer a Shawnee
he will be tied and left at the edge of the settlement.
The prisoners are not to be harmed until my medicine
directs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward halted. He was close enough for me to
see that while he had escaped a wound from the
flying stones his shoulder was blown full of powder.
The sweat streamed down his face and intimated
something of the agony he was suffering.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black Hoof is a great warrior and a mighty
chief!&#8221; he said huskily. &#8220;But Red Arrow&#8217;s medicine
is weak because it has not been fed. Only
blood will make it strong. Let this man die before
we break our camp.&#8221; And he stirred me with his
foot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The prisoners belong to the Shawnees. My
medicine may whisper to kill one of them, but the
warriors in sound of my voice must decide. Those
who would see one of the three die show the ax.&#8221;</p>
<p>Almost as soon as he had spoken the air was filled
with spinning axes, ascending to the boughs and
then falling to be deftly caught, each ax by its
owner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It is good,&#8221; said the chief. &#8220;My medicine shall
pick the prisoners to die.&#8221;</p>
<p>The explosion of the wooden cannon and the
chief&#8217;s ruling that we were no longer Ward&#8217;s prisoners
appealed to me as a reprieve. At least the girl
was snatched from Ward&#8217;s clutches. But the unanimous
vote that one of us must die threw me back
on the rack.</p>
<p>It was inconceivable that Patricia Dale should
thus die. And yet I had had an earnest of the
devil&#8217;s ferocity. East of the mountains I could not
have imagined a hand ever being raised against her.
And I had seen her buffeted and struck down this
day. Therefore, I did comprehend the inconceivable.</p>
<p>I called out to the chief:</p>
<p>&#8220;Catahecassa, listen to a white medicine, for the
red medicine is far away or else is asleep. If the
white woman is harmed you will shed tears of
blood before you reach your Scioto towns. The
settlers are swarming in to head you off. You have
no time to spend in torturing any prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;But had you many sleeps of time it would be bad
for you to harm the white girl. If you harm her
you will have nothing to trade for an open path to
the river. If you are wise in war, as your enemies
say you are, you will guard her carefully at least
until you make your villages above the Ohio.&#8221;</p>
<p>The chief&#8217;s eyes shifted uneasily, but his voice
was ominous as he tersely advised:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>&#8220;The white man had better ask his strong medicine
to keep him from the fire. One of the prisoners
shall roast this night. I have said it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He had not liked my words as they set his superstitions
to working, but it would never do for him
to bow before the threats of a white medicine. So
he remained inexorable in his determination to cover
his dead with a white victim.</p>
<p>His raid into Virginia had been disastrous even
though he could count the four Grisdols, the seven
men, women and children in Abb&#8217;s Valley in his
death score. And he had taken three prisoners.
Doubtless there were other victims at the fire I had
seen when on the Cheat. But the price he had paid
for these various kills and us three prisoners was
too heavy.</p>
<p>Every Indian slain had been a prime fighting
man, one it would take years of training to replace.
After counting his losses in the mountains about
the Grisdol clearing, the warriors killed in Abb&#8217;s
Valley, and now his losses here at Howard&#8217;s Creek,
the score was distinctly against him. No matter
how mighty and famous a chief may be, he will
surely and quickly lose his following if disaster dogs
his war-paths.</p>
<p>So I could understand Black Hoof&#8217;s mental attitude.
He attributed his misfortunes to his weakening
medicine. Let the cost be ever so dear he must
strengthen that medicine; and he firmly believed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
human sacrifice would be the most acceptable offering
he could make.</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring that man over to the fire,&#8221; he directed,
pointing to me.</p>
<p>My wrist-cords were loosed, my ankles were fastened
only with a spancel, and strong hands jerked
me to my feet. Taking short steps I advanced to
where the girl lay with her head on her father&#8217;s
breast.</p>
<p>Black Hoof selected a charred stick from the fire
and stood staring at us, his eyes blank as though he
did not see us. His warriors watched him with
much awe. His spirit was far away up in the mountains
communing with his medicine. He was asking
his manito which of the three victims would be most
acceptable.</p>
<p>Ward stood behind him, his lean face working in
helpless rage for fear the girl would be the choice,
thereby costing him a new wife. I felt deathly sick,
physically sick, fearing she was marked for death,
fearing she was reserved for worse than death.</p>
<p>Suddenly Black Hoof began shivering, then threw
back his head and for a moment stared about him
as if to collect his scattered senses. Reaching down
he pulled the girl from her father. She had
swooned and was at least spared these few minutes
of awful dread. The charred stick hovered over
her white face, then was withdrawn and darted at
mine.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>Instinctively I closed my eyes, but as the stick
failed to leave its mark I opened them and beheld
Dale had been chosen: A black smooch extended
from the tip of his nose to the roots of his hair, and
was bisected by another mark across the bridge of
his nose, and extending to his ears.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paint that man black,&#8221; Black Hoof ordered.</p>
<p>Dale was very composed. He knew the worst.
Perhaps he believed his death would save the girl.
In a steady voice he said to me:</p>
<p>&#8220;Morris, I am sorry for you. Only God knows
how I feel about Pat. I&#8217;ve been worse than a fool.
Don&#8217;t tell her when she wakes up. Get the Cousin
woman to take her out of sight. It will be very
hard but I will try to go through it like a man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If there is anything I could do!&#8221; I cried.</p>
<p>He shook his head and threw it back and his lips
were drawn tight.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am to blame. It&#8217;s best this way. You came
after me to help me. That was good and foolish
of you. Pray God she will be spared. Pray God
you will be spared. They&#8217;ll be satisfied with my
death for a while. I think I shall go through it
very well.&#8221;</p>
<p>They pulled me away and fell to rubbing the
unfortunate man&#8217;s face and neck with charcoal.
Cousin&#8217;s sister with a magnificent show of strength
gathered the unconscious girl in her arms and
walked toward the woods. Ward would have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
stopped her, but she hissed like a snake in his face,
and there was a hardness in the blue eyes he could
not withstand.</p>
<p>As she disappeared with her burden Black Hoof
said something to Lost Sister&#8217;s red husband. This
warrior, very loath to miss the spectacle of a burning,
sullenly glided after the woman. I feared he
was sent to bring them back, but as they did not
return I knew he was ordered to stand guard over
them.</p>
<p>Now the opening was filled with the Shawnees,
word having passed that Black Hoof was about to
appease his war-medicine. Only the scouts and Lost
Sister&#8217;s man remained out. Dale was stood on his
feet and his upper garments were torn off from him.
As they offered to lead him to the stake he struck
their hands aside and with firm step walked inside
the circle of brush which had been heaped up some
five feet from the stake.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and endeavored not to witness
the scene but was unable to keep them closed. With
a spancel rope fastened to his ankles Dale was further
secured by a long cord tied around one wrist
and fastened some fifteen feet up the trimmed
sapling.</p>
<p>When the flames began to bite on one side he
could hobble around the post to the opposite side.
As the flames spread he would become very active,
but each revolution around the post would shorten
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
the slack of the wrist-cord. With the entire circle
of fuel ablaze he would slowly roast. Black Hoof
muttered some gibberish and applied the torch.</p>
<p>As the first billow of smoke rose and before the
savages could commence their dancing and preliminary
tortures, Ericus Dale threw back his head and
loudly prayed:</p>
<p>&#8220;O God, protect my little girl! O God, have
mercy upon me!&#8221;</p>
<p>Black Hoof jeered him, sardonically crying:</p>
<p>&#8220;The white man makes medicine to his white
manito. Let Big Turtle<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> try him with a mouthful
of fire. We will see if the white manito is weak or
afraid to help his child.&#8221;</p>
<p>A burly warrior scooped up coals on a piece of
bark and with a fiendish grin leaped through the
smoke. Two rifle shots, so close together as to be
almost one, shattered the tense silence as the savages
held their breath to enjoy every symptom of
the excruciating agony. Dale went down on his
knees, a small blue hole showing where the bullet
mercifully had struck his heart. Big Turtle leaped
backward and fell into the burning brush. A warrior,
acting mechanically, dragged the Turtle clear
of the flames. He was stone-dead.</p>
<p>For several moments the Indians were incapable
of motion, so astounding was this interference with
their sport. It was the scream of a panther that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
awoke them to furious activity. Black Hoof shouted
for his men to catch the white scout. Then he
turned on me and raised his ax. The act was involuntary,
for at once dropping his arm he ordered his
men to extinguish the fire and to see I did not
escape. Then he hurried into the forest.</p>
<p>The fire was stamped out and Dale&#8217;s body removed
to one side. I asked them to cover the dead
man with a blanket, which they readily did. Now
Lost Sister returned, this time leading Patricia. I
called to her in Shawnee:</p>
<p>&#8220;Bring the white girl here. Does she know her
father is dead?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her. The men said he was killed by a
white bullet,&#8221; was the sullen reply.</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave her with me and wash the black from his
face,&#8221; I said.</p>
<p>She brought her charge to me. Patricia&#8217;s eyes
were hot as if with fever. She dropped beside me
and stared wildly. Then she began to remember
and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;My father is dead, they tell me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He is dead. He suffered none. It is as he
wished. He could not escape. He is at peace.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Life is so terrible,&#8221; she mumbled. &#8220;Death is so
peaceful. Death is so beautiful. Then one is so
safe.&#8221;</p>
<p>She gave a little scream and collapsed with her
head resting on my bound hands. But although her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
slender frame shook convulsively she shed no
tears.</p>
<p>I tried to talk to her as I would to a little child.
After a while she rose and her composure frightened
me. She walked to her father. Lost Sister had removed
the tell-tale black. The girl kneeled and
kissed him and patted his hair. Then returning to
me, she quietly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;He looks very peaceful. Very happy. I am glad
he did not have to suffer. The bullet that took his
life was very kind. It must be very beautiful to be
dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>She ceased speaking and slowly began stretching
her arms above her head, and with a long-drawn
scream she fell over backward and I knew she had
lost her reason.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>OUR MEDICINE GROWS STRONGER</h3>
</div>

<p>The Shawnees&#8217; anxiety to start for the Ohio
almost became a panic. The tragic manner in
which they had been robbed of their victim, the
screaming defiance of young Cousin, together with
their losses in warriors, convinced them something
was radically wrong with their war-medicine. Outwardly
Black Hoof remained calm but I knew he
was greatly worried. His medicine had designated
Dale for the torture, and then had permitted a bullet
to release the man.</p>
<p>Nor was it any small influence which the girl&#8217;s
condition exerted in this desire to retreat. She
seemed to be stunned. She walked about, but without
appearing to hear or see her captors. There
was none of the savages who did not believe her
terrible scream prefaced her crossing the dividing-line
between reason and insanity.</p>
<p>As an insane person she was under the special
protection of the great manito, and black woe to
him who interfered with her. The chief was eager
to abandon her to be picked up by the settlers at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
Howard&#8217;s Creek, but she clung tenaciously to Cousin&#8217;s
sister. The latter displayed no emotion over
this preference, yet she did not repulse the girl.
She even was gentle in caring for her.</p>
<p>Ward was for finishing me out of hand, but
Black Hoof insisted I should carry packs and make
myself useful before being dispensed with. Then
again I would be something to display at the villages
and something to dance about when it came to
appeasing the ghosts of the slain warriors. We
broke camp that night, and with malicious ingenuity
Ward strapped packs on my shoulders until my
back buckled. As he finished and was promising to
thrust his knife into my legs if I displayed any
weariness, Cousin&#8217;s sister came up and sharply directed
him to remove the packs as I was to serve as
a litter-bearer.</p>
<p>&#8220;The white woman asks for him,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Catahecassa gives him to me to help carry the
medicine-woman.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ward raged, but Black Hoof upheld the girl; and
although I knew Patricia was too insensible of her
surroundings to ask for any one, I was keen to serve
her. Lost Sister had fashioned a rude litter out of
rawhide and two saplings, slack between the poles
so the girl could not roll out. To my surprise she
stepped between the saplings at the forward end
and called on me to pick up the other end and march.
I considered it to be a man&#8217;s work, but she made
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
nothing of it, and never called a halt that she might
rest.</p>
<p>In the morning the hunters brought in some deer-meat
and turkeys, and we camped long enough to
eat. Once more Ward endeavored to prevail upon
the chief to put me out of the way. He played upon
Black Hoof&#8217;s superstitions very cunningly by declaring
the war-medicine would be very weak until
I was killed. The chief was impressed, else he never
would have come to stare at me.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that Patricia was delirious,
and it was my hand on her head that seemed to quiet
her. Lost Sister told a noble lie by volunteering
the information that it was my presence that kept
the girl quiet. Black Hoof and his braves had a
great fear of the girl when she began her rambling
talk. They believed she was surrounded by ghosts
and talking with them. So Ward&#8217;s request was
refused, and stern orders were given that I should
not be harmed. When the home villages were
reached, he added, I might be burned.</p>
<p>When we made our second camp on the Kanawha
I called Black Hoof to me. I had been staked out
in spread-eagle fashion and my guards had placed
saplings across my body and were preparing to lie
down on the ends at each side of me. I assured the
chief there was no danger of my running away, as
my medicine would wither and die, did I forsake the
great manito&#8217;s child; and I asked him to relieve me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
of the cords and saplings. He told the warriors to
omit the cords.</p>
<p>The next time we halted to snatch a few hours&#8217;
sleep he ordered that no more saplings be placed
across me, that it would be sufficient to tie my
ankles and wrists. This was a great relief. During
this portion of the march the girl seemed oblivious
to her surroundings, also to the fact that she was a
captive. She showed a strong preference for Lost
Sister&#8217;s company, and would glance about worriedly
if the young woman left her sight.</p>
<p>So it devolved on the two of us, both white, to
care for her. There were times when she babbled
of faraway scenes, of Williamsburg and her old
home, of the streets of Norfolk and Richmond. She
talked with those she had known as children. When
in this condition the Indians were glad to keep away
from us. Even Ward would not willingly remain
within hearing of her sweet voice could he avoid
so doing. And alas! There were other times when
she was almost violent, when only Lost Sister could
soothe and quiet her.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the mouth of the Great
Kanawha no guard was kept over me that I could
perceive; nor were my limbs any longer bound at
night. At each camp Lost Sister ranged the woods
and brought in roots and herbs and made strange-smelling
messes in a camp kettle and assiduously
dosed the girl.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span></p>
<p>Rafts were quickly knocked together and the
crossing made to the Indian shore. I had expected
the band to dig out hidden canoes and descend to
the mouth of the Scioto. Instead we struck into a
trail across-country. The path was well worn, and
the fork we followed ended at the Scioto above
Chillicothe, the principal Shawnee town.</p>
<p>Much of the distance Patricia walked, although
the litter was taken along for her convenience. Lost
Sister talked with me at times and I began to feel
that the barrier between us was much lower. But
she never spoke of the settlements or her brother.
Her talk was always a red talk and she never addressed
me except in Shawnee.</p>
<p>From her I learned we were making for Cornstalk&#8217;s
Town, some twenty-five miles above Chillicothe,
located on Scippo Creek. Among border
men this region was known as the Pickaway Plains.
Near our destination was Grenadier Squaw&#8217;s Town,
named after Cornstalk&#8217;s gigantic sister.</p>
<p>I suffered no incivility during the overland
march. My status became that of an attendant on
the great manito&#8217;s medicine-child. Patricia continued
in a dazed state of mind, but after two days of
arduous travel I detected her weeping. Lost Sister
enigmatically warned:</p>
<p>&#8220;She is another woman. She is more like the
woman she once was. She must keep close to her
manito.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span></p>
<p>I could interpret this only to mean that the girl
was recovering from her mental shock and was
recalling bits of the past, and that she was safe
only so long as the savages believed her to be insane.
At our last camp from Cornstalk&#8217;s Town
Patricia insisted on walking beside me when the
trace would permit it and she startled me by saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;My father was good to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember me?&#8221; I asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember you, Basdel? Why, of course. What
a queer question.&#8221; Then with a little frown she
sighed and complained. &#8220;But I don&#8217;t understand
why I am here with you and these Indians. I wonder
if it is a bad dream, if I will soon wake up.&#8221;</p>
<p>I blundered along the best I could, striving to
say nothing which might upset her. She suddenly
refused to talk and began displaying much physical
nervousness. Lost Sister promptly took her in hand
and led her some distance in advance of me. That
was the day the band split up, the bulk of the warriors
leaving to go to their different villages. Half
a dozen remained to press on to Cornstalk&#8217;s Town.</p>
<p>Ward was among those who left us and he was
unwilling to go. His departure was a great relief
to me. His presence frightened the girl, although
she gave no sign of remembering him as having
been a factor in her life. It was due entirely to Lost
Sister&#8217;s appeal to Black Hoof that the renegade was
ordered to Chillicothe.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span></p>
<p>As he was leaving us he promised me:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll yet see you eating fire. That white squaw
will see me again.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll dance your mangy scalp some time,&#8221; I retorted.</p>
<p>Whereat he used terms of abuse he had picked
up from traders, and I struck him with my fist.
Black Hoof stopped him from killing me, and
threatened me with torture if I offended again.
Then he ordered Ward to go.</p>
<p>The chief continued with us to Cornstalk&#8217;s Town,
but Cornstalk was not there; so he went in search
of him at Grenadier Squaw&#8217;s Town. Before leaving
he gave orders that I was not to be molested so
long as I did not attempt to escape. The town was
inhabited by women and children largely, with a
dozen men left to act as hunters.</p>
<p>It was plain that the fighting men of the tribe
were gathering somewhere, probably at Chillicothe.
Patricia was believed to be in touch with the manito,
and was feared and respected accordingly. The
days that followed were not unhappy for me; and
Patricia appeared to be contented in a numb sort of
way.</p>
<p>My own reaction to the anxieties and fears of
our captivity devitalized me to a certain degree, I
believed; else, I would not have been contented to
settle down to the drowsy existence of village life.
I did no hunting. I was a companion to the girl
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
when she wished for my company. Aside from
that capacity the Indians looked on me as if I had
been a tree.</p>
<p>I talked on general subjects with Lost Sister, always
waiting for her to blaze the trace our words
were to follow. Her red husband remained aloof
from her from the day she took charge of Patricia.
Whether he resented her companionship with us I
do not know, and after our arrival he disappeared
for a time.</p>
<p>I discovered I was lacking in curiosity as to what
each morrow had in store for us. It savored of the
indifference of the fatalist. But I did come to the
alert when I observed Patricia was rapidly returning
to normal. I remembered Lost Sister&#8217;s warning,
&#8220;She must keep close to her manito.&#8221; I was
forced to repeat these words to her.</p>
<p>It was one of the hardest tasks I ever undertook.
She suffered deeply when she began to grasp my
meaning. She began to remember things concretely.
Yet life was the stake, and the fact that my
life was also involved helped her much. With the
aid of Lost Sister I taught her how to be ever on
her guard, how to carry herself when in the presence
of the silent but ever watchful Indians.</p>
<p>Once the shock wore off somewhat she found it
was not difficult to keep up her rôle. The most effective
way to allay any suspicion was for her to
talk aloud to herself. The savages believed she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
holding conversation with inmates of the invisible
world, and drew away from her. But while she improved,
my lethargy continued. My physical and
mental strength seemed to be sapped. I was content
to lie on the bank of the creek, my mind idling with
vagaries.</p>
<p>Some six weeks passed in this desultory fashion,
then Cornstalk and Black Hoof returned to the village
with three warriors and a negro woman. The
woman had been captured at Sapling Grove within
three hundred yards of Captain Evan Shelby&#8217;s
house, the woman told me. She also informed me
that her captors were led by a very large man,
much whiter than any of his companions, and that
he talked good English.</p>
<p>This description fitted either John Logan or Will
Emery, the Cherokee half-breed. I decided the
man was Logan. The woman was treated kindly.
Immediately on arrival the two chiefs retired to a
wigwam for a long talk. Then Black Hoof sent
for me and Patricia. I warned her to pay no attention
to them, and to talk much to herself. She
acted admirably and was kept in the wigwam only
a few minutes.</p>
<p>Cornstalk had watched her closely, and both he
and Black Hoof were uneasy and relieved when she
departed. Toward me their manner was incisive,
and they demanded certain information. As I knew
conditions had changed vastly since I was captured
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
I talked freely and improvised considerably. There
was no military value whatever to the news that I
imparted.</p>
<p>Cornstalk, who was a large man and of a commanding
appearance, and possessing unusual intellectual
powers, was keen to learn about individuals,
especially about Daniel Boone. He asked how
many men Boone could lead against the Shawnees.
I told him all the border men would be glad to
serve under him, that he was collecting fighting
men when I was taken prisoner.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your tongue is split,&#8221; Cornstalk warned. &#8220;Be
careful, or we will say that young medicine-woman
does not need a liar to care for her. Be careful, or
your tongue will be pulled out. The Shawnees will
be glad to warm themselves at your fire. That man
was sent to the Falls of the Ohio. He has returned
to the settlements. He commands three forts in
the lower valleys. Will he head riflemen to battle,
or stay at the forts?&#8221;</p>
<p>I truthfully answered that I believed he would be
given an important command. And I explained how
Colonel Lewis would be over him as he would be
over many other brave leaders. They knew Lewis
and feared him. Their faces were very glum until
I repeated Connolly&#8217;s message to Charles Lewis that
peace with the tribes was very possible. Then they
smiled grimly and Cornstalk informed me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Dunmore ordered his Long Knives to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
march against Shawnee towns ten sleeps after you
were captured.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>
<p>I was startled at the information and glanced
through the opening of the wigwam as if expecting
to see the lean militia men breaking from the woods.
The chief added:</p>
<p>&#8220;But they seem to have trouble in starting. Perhaps
they are very old men and can not walk fast.
I shall send my young men across the Ohio to dig
them out of the mud.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Cherokees will not join the Shawnees,&#8221; I
ventured.</p>
<p>Cornstalk eyed me menacingly.</p>
<p>&#8220;They will not because they have old women
among them. They put their powder in bags, and
put the bags in caves. Their powder is spoiled.
After I whip your army the Cherokees will carry
their axes into the Carolinas.&#8221;</p>
<p>I believed the Cherokees would do this, if our
army were whipped. Turning to Black Hoof, Cornstalk
asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;How long before you roast this white man?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;After we have whipped the army of Dunmore
and Lewis and Boone. Now he waits on the medicine-woman.
After the battle there will be many
white women to wait on her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></p>
<p>I was dismissed and on reaching the open air I
discovered I had left all my apathy behind me. The
importance of time and the imperative need of immediate
action was burned into my brain by Black
Hoof&#8217;s words. I sought Patricia and found her
seated on the bank, staring into the sluggish waters.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was thinking of you, Basdel,&#8221; she greeted, and
she reached her hand to me. &#8220;I was remembering
what I said in Salem about your rifle. I&#8217;m sorry.
I did wrong.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Heavens, child! Abuse the rifle all you will!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was abuse of you and of all that your rifle
stood for. I mocked you because you were from
the border. Poor father! He knew many Indians,
but he did not understand them. Town ways seem
mighty small and of no account now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patsy, you must get a grip on yourself. We
must get clear of this village at once. We must get
back to Virginia.&#8221;</p>
<p>She shivered and her eyes dilated as she stared
at me and she muttered:</p>
<p>&#8220;I dread the woods, the silence, the darkness.
The wolves howling at night. Worst of all is the
creeping horror of being chased. No! No! I
can&#8217;t stand any more, Basdel. The black horror
comes over me when I let myself think of it. The
dank woods&mdash;the silence&mdash;the awful stealth of
night. No, no, Basdel. Let me die here.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patsy, grip yourself! You can&#8217;t stay among
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
these beggars. They think you are insane. That&#8217;s
why they&#8217;ve spared you. But there&#8217;s going to be a
battle soon. If they win they&#8217;ll bring many prisoners
here. You must not be here then.&#8221;</p>
<p>She interrupted me with a little heart-broken cry
and clapped her hands to her eyes to blot out some
horrid picture. It was harsh, but the way she was
inclining led to permanent madness.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will steal away and make the Ohio. The
Indians are busy planning for the big battle.
They&#8217;ll not spare many men to seek us. I will take
you back to Virginia and across the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Or we will both die,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;That
wouldn&#8217;t be bad. To die and be out of it all&mdash;But
I mustn&#8217;t speak for you, Basdel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You speak for both of us,&#8221; I comforted. &#8220;Death
isn&#8217;t terrible. This is.&#8221; And I swept my hand in a
half-circle at the Shawnee wigwams forming the
village. &#8220;Say nothing to Cousin&#8217;s sister. I will
make my plans at once. A gun, some powder and
lead, and then we will go.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And never come back to them alive?&#8221; she insisted,
and she leaned forward and stared intently
into my eyes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Never alive, sweetheart.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That is much better,&#8221; she quietly remarked.
&#8220;And here comes my sister. She has been very
good to me. I wish we could take her with us.
Over the mountains, or to death.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She refused to go over the mountains with her
brother. We must tell her nothing,&#8221; I warned.</p>
<p>Lost Sister gave me a quick glance as she came
up. She gazed at Patricia in silence for a moment,
then warned:</p>
<p>&#8220;The white woman must keep close to her manito.
The eyes of the eagle and the ears of the fox are
in this village.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She is having bad thoughts,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Lead
her thoughts through new paths.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I strolled away I heard her beginning a Shawnee
myth, in which it was explained why the wet-hawk
feeds while flying, and how the small turkey-buzzard
got its tufted head.</p>
<p>According to the notches cut in my long stick it
was the first day of September. Now that Cornstalk
was back and in conference with Black Hoof
the village became a center of importance. Notable
chiefs and medicine-men of the northern tribes
began to assemble. Lost Sister pointed out to me
Puck-e-shin-wa, father of a six-year-old boy, who
was to become one of the most remarkable Indian
characters in our history, under the name of Tecumseh.</p>
<p>Young Ellinipsico, son of Cornstalk, was there,
gay in his war-trappings and eager for the battle.
Blue Jacket, another famous Shawnee chief and
warrior, was in attendance. Of the allied tribes I
saw Chiyawee the Wyandot, Scoppathus the Mingo,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
Redhawk the Delaware, and most interesting of all,
John Logan, chief of the Mingos.</p>
<p>He was the son of a French man, who was
adopted by the Oneidas, but he always claimed kin
to the Cayuga, the term &#8220;Mingo&#8221; being loosely applied
by our border men to any fragments of the
Iroquois living outside the Long House in New
York Province. Logan came and went inside an
hour, spending all his time in a secret conference
with Cornstalk.</p>
<p>I saw him as he strode through the little village,
looking neither to right nor left, saturnine of countenance.
He showed his white blood, being much
lighter in complexion than the full-bloods. A warrior
walked behind him, carrying his gun. The
chief himself carried a long wand decorated with
the ten or twelve scalps he had taken since Baker
and Greathouse massacred his people at Baker&#8217;s
Bottom.</p>
<p>Young Cherokees, stolen away from their nation
to be in at the death of the white race in Virginia,
were present without leaders. Black Hoof&#8217;s long
absence from the villages was explained when a full
score Ottawas filed into the opening and sang their
war-song. Their spokesman loudly announced that
they were but the advance of many of their tribe.</p>
<p>I feared I had waited too long, and was much
relieved to learn from Lost Sister that warriors and
chiefs were to move to Chillicothe at once and there
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
await the coming of the western bands. Their going
would leave our village practically deserted except
for aged and broken men and the women and children.</p>
<p>Lost Sister said her husband was eager to take
the path, and that it was Cornstalk&#8217;s plan to cross
the Ohio instead of waiting to be attacked in his
own country. She was vague as to the chief&#8217;s exact
plans once he had crossed the river, but by joining
her brief statements together I was led to believe
Cornstalk had learned that the Virginia forces had
been split into two armies, and that the masterly red
strategist planned to surprise and annihilate one,
and then attack the second. This information alone
was of sufficient importance for me to risk my life
many times in order to apprise my superiors of the
trap being set for them.</p>
<p>By the time the sun was half-way down the afternoon
sky all the chiefs were moving down the river
bound for Chillicothe. Young Ellinipsico and a
mixed band of warriors were left to arrange for
guarding the girl. He would depart for Chillicothe
on the morrow. I went in search of the girl and
met Lost Sister standing by a big honey-tree. She
asked me if I had seen her husband, and looked worried
when I shook my head.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he would not go without seeing me, and
yet he is not here in the village. Your white woman&mdash;she
walks far from her manito. It is bad for her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She must leave here,&#8221; I boldly said. &#8220;I must
take her away.&#8221; I had had no intention of taking
her into my confidence, but I realized it would be
impossible to make a start without her missing the
girl. So I took the desperate course and did what
I had warned Patricia not to do.</p>
<p>She drew her knife and cut some straight marks
on the honey-tree.</p>
<p>&#8220;You see those?&#8221; she asked.</p>
<p>I bowed my head. Without explaining the
relevancy of her question, she turned and walked
rapidly toward the village. I stared at the marks
and they told me nothing. There was nothing pictorial
about them. I followed her among the wigwams,
and was in time to see her leading Patricia
into her wigwam. I sauntered after them, obsessed
by the notion that strange forces were at work. The
village seemed to be quiet and sleepy and yet the air
was surcharged with threats of things about to
happen.</p>
<p>When the storm broke it was from a quarter entirely
different from anything I could have imagined.
My first intimation that something unusual
was happening was when a Shawnee ran into
the village and began talking to Ellinipsico, who was
lounging sleepily on the grass before his father&#8217;s
wigwam. I heard Ellinipsico exclaim:</p>
<p>&#8220;He must not be hurt. He has felt the hand of
the great manito on his head.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span></p>
<p>I looked about for a weapon, so that I might go
down fighting, for I first thought the stranger
Indians were demanding me for a plaything, not
understanding my true status as servant to the
medicine-woman. I knew this was not the solution
of the affair when Ellinipsico jumped to his feet and
ran to the edge of the village, at every bound shouting
to the Ottawas to hurry back to the village.</p>
<p>A loud outcry answered him from the forest. To
my amazement Ellinipsico slowed down his mad
pace and appeared to be reluctant to enter the woods.
The few Shawnees and Mingos in the village followed
his example in timidity. Then above the war-cry
of the Ottawas rose the roar of Baby Kirst,
punctuated by the crack of a rifle and the death-yell
of a savage.</p>
<p>Now I understood. The Ottawas, ignorant of
Kirst&#8217;s condition, had met him blundering through
the woods and had essayed to halt his progress. He
promptly had offered fight, and they were at it, with
the odds greatly in favor of the Indians. In my
excitement I ran to where Ellinipsico stood. He
was dancing with rage and fright. Beholding me,
he ordered me to dive into the growth and stop the
fight.</p>
<p>I glanced back and saw Lost Sister and Patricia
leaving the wigwam. Lost Sister began leading her
charge toward the south end of the village and
jerked her head at me as though calling on me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
follow. It was driven into my mind that this was
the time to escape with the girl. I plunged into the
woods and no Indian cared to dog my steps.</p>
<p>I made as if to go to the scene of the fearful confusion,
but once out of sight of Ellinipsico and his
men I turned to intercept the course taken by Lost
Sister and Patricia. I miscalculated the distance,
or else the combatants made a rapid shift of ground,
for before I knew it I was standing on the edge of
a most ferocious struggle. Kirst was still mounted
and bleeding from a dozen wounds. His long rifle
was being swung for a club.</p>
<p>My first view of him was as he splintered the butt
on an Ottawa head. He bawled in triumph. The
Ottawas, expecting no diversion so near the village,
were armed only with their knives and axes. A
fellow leaped on to the horse and tried to stab him
from behind, and one immense hand reached back
and caught him by the neck and held him in midair,
and squeezed the life from the painted body,
and then hurled him among the remaining warriors.</p>
<p>The girl must come first, but it was not in my
heart to pass without contributing something to
Kirst&#8217;s advantage. I snatched up a war-club,
dropped by a slain savage, and hurled it into the
thick of them, bowling over two. Kirst&#8217;s horse went
down, disemboweled. Now Kirst was at a great disadvantage,
but his long arms gathered up two of the
Ottawas, and I heard their ribs crack, as with a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
pleased grunt the simple fellow contracted his embrace.</p>
<p>But now they were piling upon him, striking and
stabbing, a living mound which for the moment
concealed the big fellow. Then the mass began to
disintegrate, and savages staggered back and fell
dead, or suffering from terrible wounds. Kirst
rose to his feet only to fall on his face as if shot
through the head, although he received no wound
at the time that I could perceive.</p>
<p>My last glance was fleeting, but it sufficed to
count six silent forms of Ottawas who would never
cross the Ohio to attack Lord Dunmore&#8217;s armies.
One Indian, gasping with pain, with both arms
hanging like rags, lurched by me but not seeing me,
his gaping mouth trying to sound his death-song.
Ellinipsico was calling on his men to follow him,
and I sped away.</p>
<p>Baby Kirst had fulfilled his destiny and would
babble his way through the forests no more. The
force which had destroyed his reason had paid the
full price the law of compensation had worked out.</p>
<p>Could I find the girl without returning to the
village I hoped the confusion resulting from the
bloody struggle would permit me to steal away with
her. I swung back toward the opening and soon
discovered Patricia and Lost Sister. The latter on
beholding me called me by name, the first time she
had ever done so. As I ran to them she fiercely
said:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Take your white woman and go! Cross the
Ohio but do not go up the Kanawha. Follow the
Guyandotte or Sandy, into the valley of the Clinch.
You must hurry!&#8221;</p>
<p>As if the day had not been hideous enough a
bepainted warrior burst through the undergrowth as
she finished, with his bow raised and an arrow
drawn to the head. Beneath the war vermilion,
I recognized Lost Sister&#8217;s husband. She threw out
her arms and smiled scornfully and cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;You hide in the bushes to watch me? I thought
so.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then she was down with an arrow buried to the
feathers.</p>
<p>I leaped into the bushes and grappled with the
murderer before he could draw another arrow from
his quiver. He dropped his bow and endeavored to
hurl me to the ground. As we whirled about I saw
Patricia kneeling beside Lost Sister and striving to
pet her back to life. One glimpse, and then all my
attention was needed for my adversary. He was
quicker than I, and his freshly oiled body made him
hard to hold; but I was far the stronger.</p>
<p>&#8220;His knife, Basdel; Look out;&#8221; screamed Patricia;
and I was glad to note there was no madness
in her voice.</p>
<p>I had him by his right wrist, my left arm shoved
under his chin and into his red throat. The girl&#8217;s
gaze sent my gaze downward. He was trying to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span>
work the knife from its sheath before I could force
him backward or break his neck. But the sheath
was too long for the knife and he could not reach
the handle with his fingers until he had forced the
blade upward by pinching the tip of the sheath. I
did not try to interfere with his maneuver, but settled
myself solidly to hold him from escaping.</p>
<p>&#8220;The knife, Basdel!&#8221; she shrilly repeated. Then
she nearly upset my calculations by trying to thrust
a bough between my foe&#8217;s feet. Only by a nimble
maneuver did I escape being tripped; but it was
heartening to know Patricia could respond to my
needs.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stand clear!&#8221; I panted. &#8220;I have him!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But the knife!&#8221; she despairingly cried.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s getting it for me!&#8221; I replied.</p>
<p>Now he had managed to work the haft clear of the
leather and his left hand was closing on it. His
eyes told me that much. Instantly I changed my
tactics. I dropped my left arm to seize his left
wrist. I released his right wrist and with my free
hand tore the weapon from his grasp. He struck me
in the head with his free fist, but I felt it none as he
did not have the white man&#8217;s trick of delivering a
buffet. We went down side by side, and by the
time we had rolled over once he was dead by his
own knife.</p>
<p>Retaining the weapon, I ran to Patricia as she
collapsed by the side of the dying woman.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am all right! Get up!&#8221; I commanded.</p>
<p>Cousin&#8217;s sister smiled grimly, and whispered:</p>
<p>&#8220;He has been watching us. He saw me come here
when I scratched the tree. He has been hiding&mdash;The
marks I made on the honey-tree&mdash;Look behind
it&mdash;the pea-vines&mdash;. Tell Shelby I send him a little
sister&mdash;&#8221; And she had solved all her problems,
and had passed into the compassion of the manito
whose gentleness and understanding surpass all
comprehension.</p>
<p>Patricia was weeping softly, as one who sorrows
with an aching heart, but not as one who is afraid.
I gathered her up in my arms and made for the
honey-tree close by. I stood her on her feet, and
exhorted her to be brave as the time had come for
us to take to flight. I plunged into the pea-vines
behind the tree. A new thrill of life fired me as I
fished out my own rifle, a powder-horn, shot-pouch
and linen patches. Cousin&#8217;s sister had even remembered
to provide a roll of buckskin and an awl for
mending our moccasins, and a small package of
smoked meat.</p>
<p>Thus armed once more I took the girl&#8217;s hand and
stole through the woods, following the well-beaten
path that led to Chillicothe, and planning to swing
to the east and skirt the town under the cover of
darkness. I desired to emerge on the Ohio at a
point opposite the mouth of the Big Sandy. For
some time we could hear the wailing and howling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
of the Shawnees in Cornstalk&#8217;s Town as they
mourned for the dead Ottawas, and Patricia was
sadly frightened. My ears were tingling for fear
they would catch the cry of discovery, but young
Ellinipsico was there instead of Black Hoof, and
our flight was undiscovered.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>BACK TO THE BLUE WALL</h3>
</div>

<p>We reached the Ohio and I soon found a
canoe. The trip down the Scioto had its
danger thrills, and twice we narrowly escaped meeting
bands of warriors on the main trace. I stuck
to the path because of its advantages. None below
us knew we had left the upper town, and would
not be looking for us. In the beaten path there was
much less chance of leaving signs for some scout
to pick up and follow. I knew warriors would be
scouring the country in all directions once the news
of our escape was carried to Chillicothe, but the
Scioto path was the last one they would expect us
to take.</p>
<p>I had remembered Lost Sister&#8217;s warning and
planned to follow the Big Sandy until its head
waters interlocked with those of the Clinch and
Holston. It was nerve-wearing work, that crossing
of the Ohio. With each dip of the paddle I expected
rifles to crack behind me and canoes to poke their
noses through the overhanging foliage and make
after us. I could not see that the girl breathed during
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
the crossing, and I kept her in front of me as her
face was a mirror to reflect instantly any danger on
the Indian shore.</p>
<p>We landed at the mouth of Four-Mile Creek without
any disturbing incidents. I told her we were
four miles above the mouth of the Scioto and she
was for placing more distance between us and that
river at once. But it was impossible to travel all
the time. Now we were foot-free, and as I had my
rifle the Shawnees would pay high before catching
up with us, I assured her. I had been at Four-Mile
Creek the year before to survey five hundred acres
of good bottom-land for Patrick Henry, and was of
course familiar with the locality.</p>
<p>Five hundred yards back from the Ohio was an
old fort. I took the girl there to rest while I
patched our moccasins. The Indians said this structure
was so ancient that no one knew who built it.
As a matter of fact it was the remains of George
Croghan&#8217;s stone trading-house. Traces of an Indian
town, antedating the fort, were also to be observed.
Very possibly it was occupied by the Shawnees
before they built their first town at the mouth
of the Scioto on the west bank. It was from this
Scioto town that Mary Ingles escaped in 1755, and
the history of her daring and hardships rather belittled
my feat in bringing Patricia from the upper
town.</p>
<p>The poor girl continued extremely nervous and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
I feared she would collapse. Now that she had
tasted freedom she feared the Indians were hot on
our trail. Her gaze was constantly roving to the
Ohio. She was fearing to behold the Shawnees
paddling across to recapture us. The moccasins
had to be mended, however, as the night travel down
the Scioto path had sadly damaged them.</p>
<p>As I sewed the whangs through the rips and
hastily patched the holes I could see her worriment
was increasing. That period of delay was more
trying to her fortitude than when we were making
the détour around Chillicothe and our very lives
hung on luck, or the mercy of her manito.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something in the river,&#8221; she whispered,
her slight figure growing rigid.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a log,&#8221; I told her.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look! Isn&#8217;t there something moving in the
bushes?&#8221; And she clutched my arm.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only the wind ruffling the tops,&#8221; I soothed.</p>
<p>She was silent for a few minutes and then confessed:</p>
<p>&#8220;I dread and hate the river, Basdel. I wish we
could get out of sight of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a short trip in the canoe to the Big Sandy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And with the possibility of an Indian hiding
behind every stump and log along the shore!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we will hide the canoe and strike across
the bend. A few creeks to cross, and inside of two
days we should reach the Big Sandy. It&#8217;s about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
thirty-five miles and there is the blaze left by the
surveyors. Do you wish that? It will be harder
for your feet than riding in the canoe. It may be
easier on your nerves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Anything, Basdel, to get away from the river!
And can&#8217;t we start now? I know we shall see the
Indians coming across to catch us if we stay here
much longer.&#8221;</p>
<p>I tossed her her moccasins and quickly mended
mine and put them on. Leaving her to wait until
I could draw up the canoe and hide it, I proceeded
to conceal all traces of our landing as best I could,
and then told her I was ready.</p>
<p>The bottoms on this side of the river are narrower
than on the Indian shore, and the old surveyors&#8217;
blaze proved to be a wet path. The small
creeks were bordered with cane and when we encountered
them it was hard on the girl. But she
minded hardships none, and once we were out of
sight of the river she regained some of her spirits.
But a glimpse of the blue river brought back her old
fears as though the Ohio were some monster able to
reach out and seize her.</p>
<p>Before night I proved the river could be good to
us. Against her will I had swung down to the shore
and was leading her along a narrow beach in order
to escape a bad tangle of briers when I had the
good fortune to discover a bateau lodged against the
bank. The girl begged me not to go near it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span>
although it was obviously empty. I insisted and
was rewarded with a bag containing a bushel of
corn. Now we could have cooked it in our kettle
had we been provided with that indispensable article.
As it was there was life in munching the corn.</p>
<p>The undergrowth was a nuisance, being composed
of pea-vines, clover, nettles, cane and briery berry
bushes. I would not stop to camp until I could
reach a tract free from the stuff. As a result it was
nearly sunset by the time we halted in a mixed
growth of hickory, ironwood and ash on the banks
of a tiny creek. Here we could pick a path that
left no signs. We rested a bit and then followed the
creek toward its outlet for half a mile and came to
a log cabin.</p>
<p>The girl dropped to the ground, glaring as if we
were beholding the painted head of a Shawnee. I
assured her it was a white man&#8217;s cabin and probably
empty. Leaving her behind an elm, I scouted the
place and satisfied myself there had been no recent
visitors there. I called to her to join me and proudly
displayed an iron kettle I had found by the door.
But when I would have left her to make the kettle
boil while I looked for a turkey, she refused to stay
and insisted on accompanying me.</p>
<p>Fortunately I perched a turkey within two hundred
feet of the cabin. I hung the kettle in the fireplace
and built a good fire under it and then dressed
the turkey. For some reason the girl preferred the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
open to the cabin and remained outside the door.
As I finished my task she called to me excitedly.
Grabbing my rifle, I ran out. She was pointing
dramatically at a big blaze on a mulberry-tree. The
scar was fresh, and on it some one had written with
a charred stick:</p>
<p>Found some people killed here. We are gone
down this way. Douglass.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221; she whispered, her eyes
very big as she stared at the dusky forest wall.</p>
<p>&#8220;That would be James Douglass,&#8221; I mused. &#8220;He
came down here with Floyd&#8217;s surveying-party last
spring. I wonder who was killed.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Enough to know the Indians have been here,&#8221;
she said, drawing closer to me. &#8220;Can&#8217;t we go the
way they did and be safe?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We might make it. But &#8217;gone down this way&#8217;
means they started for New Orleans. A long,
roundabout journey to Williamsburg.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never that! I didn&#8217;t understand,&#8221; she cried.
&#8220;I will be braver. But if the nearest way home was
by the Ohio I would go by land. Anything but the
river! Remember your promise that we are not to
be taken alive. Now let&#8217;s push on.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And leave this excellent shelter?&#8221; I protested.</p>
<p>&#8220;Men have been killed here. I can&#8217;t abide it. A
few miles more&mdash;please.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></p>
<p>Of course she had her own way, but I made her
wait until we had cooked some corn to a mush and
I had broiled the turkey. I could have told her it
would be difficult for us to select any spot along
the river which had not been the scene of a killing.
So we took the kettle and left a stout, snug cabin
and pushed on through the darkness to the top of a
low ridge, where I insisted we must camp. We
made no fire.</p>
<p>I estimated the day&#8217;s travel to have been twelve
miles at the least, which was a good stint for a man,
let alone a girl unused to the forest. Nor had the
work wearied her unduly. At least she had gained
something from her captivity&mdash;a strength to endure
physical hardships which she had never known
before. With good luck and half-way decent footing
I believed another sunset would find us at the
Big Sandy. That night was cold and I sorely regretted
our lack of blankets.</p>
<p>Before sunrise I had a fire burning and the kettle
of mush slung on a green sapling for further
cooking. Patricia was curled up like a kitten, and
I recovered my hunting-shirt and slipped it on without
her knowing I had loaned it to her for a covering.
She opened her eyes and watched me a few
moments without comprehending where she was.
With a little cry she jumped to her feet and roundly
unbraided me for not calling her to help in the work.</p>
<p>I pointed out a spring, and by the time she was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span>
ready to eat the hot mush and cold turkey, the fire
was out and we were ready to march. Our lack of
salt was all that prevented the meal from being very
appetizing. We were not inclined to quarrel with
our good fortune, however, but ate enough to last
us the day. As the first rays touched the tops of
the trees we resumed the journey.</p>
<p>We covered a good ten miles when we had our
first serious mishap since leaving the Indian village.
Patricia had insisted she be allowed to take
the lead where the blazed trees made the trace easy
to follow. I humored her, for she kept within a
rod of me. We struck into a bottom and had to
pick our way through a stretch of cane.</p>
<p>Afraid she might stumble on to a bear and be
sadly frightened, I called on her to wait for me.
But she discovered a blaze on a sycamore beyond
the cane and hurried forward. Half-way through
the cane she slipped on a wet root and fell on her
side. Ordinarily the accident would not have been
serious, but the moment I saw the expression of
pain driving her face white I knew she was hurt.
I dropped the kettle and picked her up. She winced
and groaned and said it was her arm. I carried her
to the high ground and made her sit while I examined
her hurt. I expected to find the bone broken.
I was happily disappointed, and yet she was hurt
grievously enough. A section of cane had penetrated
the upper arm near the shoulder, making a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span>
nasty wound. As the cane had broken off in the
flesh it was necessary for me to play the surgeon.
Using a pair of bullet-molds I managed to secure a
grip on the ugly splinter and pull it out. She gave
a little yelp, but did not move.</p>
<p>&#8220;The worst is over,&#8221; I told her. &#8220;Now we must
dress it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Returning and securing the kettle, I dipped water
from a spring and lighted a fire and hung the kettle
to boil. Then I hunted for Indian medicine. I
soon found it, the bark of a linn or bee-tree root.
This I pounded and bruised with the butt of my
rifle and threw it into the kettle to boil. Patricia
remained very patient and quiet, her eyes following
my every move.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as useful as a housewife, Basdel,&#8221; she
remarked. &#8220;More useful than most women could
be.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a trick learned from the environment,&#8221; I
lightly replied. &#8220;Does it hurt much?&#8221; This was
rhetorical, for I knew a stab wound from the cane
smarted and ached most disagreeably.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; she bravely replied. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to
bother you, though.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll soon be as fit as a fiddle,&#8221; I assured her.
&#8220;Border men are continually helping each other in
this fashion.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as the kettle boiled I washed the wound
in the liquid and made sure all of the cane had been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
removed. This additional probing caused her pain
but she showed no signs not even by flinching. The
application at once had a soothing effect. We
waited until the medicine had cooked down to a
jelly-like consistency, when I applied it as a salve,
working it into and thoroughly covering the wound.
Then I tied it up with a strip torn from her skirt.
Rather rough surgery, but I knew it would be effective.</p>
<p>She bitterly lamented over the time we were losing,
and blamed herself so severely that I finally
consented to go on, providing she would keep behind
me. Had the hurt been in her foot we would have
been forced to camp for several days.</p>
<p>Toward night the country grew more broken and
much rougher, and I knew we were nearing the
Sandy. I feared she might trip over some obstacle,
and we camped before the light deserted us. I told
her we were within a few miles of the river and that
we ought to strike it at the mouth of Savage Creek,
some four or five miles from the Ohio. After starting
a fire, she volunteered to remain and feed it
while I looked for game. This in the way of doing
penance, perhaps. I had the good luck to shoot a
deer and we dined on venison.</p>
<p>After we had eaten she sat close by the fire and
was silent for many minutes. That she was meditating
deeply was shown by her indifference to the
night sounds which usually perturbed her. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
howling of the wolves, and the scream of a panther,
leaping to make a kill, passed unheard. Suddenly
she declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;You were right, Basdel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About what, Patsy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;About my not fitting in west of the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was said before you were tried. No woman,
even border-born, could be more brave than
you have been.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And I was so woefully wrong when I made fun
of your long rifle. I want you to forgive me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Patsy, don&#8217;t. You are wonderful.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Still being good to me, Basdel. But I know the
truth now. Back over the mountains I was wicked
enough to feel a little superior to frontier folks. No.
Don&#8217;t wave your hands at me. I must say it. I
even felt a little bit of contempt for those brave
women who went barefooted. God forgive me! I
was a cat, Basdel. A vicious cat!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Good heavens, Patsy! Say it all and have done
with it. Call yourself a pirate.&#8221;</p>
<p>She would not respond to my banter, but fell to
staring into the handful of coals. Then the tears
began streaming down her face, and at last she
sobbed:</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor girl! Poor girl! She was a wonderful
friend to me. She never had any chance, and you
can never know how hard she tried to keep my
spirits up; how ready she was to stand between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
me and harm&mdash;me, who has had every chance!
And to end like that! And yet it was far worse to
live like that. It&#8217;s best as it is, but God must be
very good to her to make up for what she lost.
Tell me, Basdel, did she suffer much when she
died?&#8221;</p>
<p>She could be talking only of Cousin&#8217;s sister. I
declared:</p>
<p>&#8220;She suffered none. It&#8217;s best for her as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>She fell asleep with her back against a black
walnut, and I spread my hunting-shirt over her,
for the air was shrewdly cool. In the dying coals
I saw pictures, wherein Kirst, Dale, and Lost Sister
paraded in turn; the fate of each the result of race-hatred,
and a race-avidity to possess the land. And
a great fear came over me that the girl leaning
against the walnut, the mass of blue-black hair
seeming to bow down the proud head, was destined
to be added to the purchase-price the frontier was
ever paying.</p>
<p>It was her talk and tears that induced this mood,
for I knew the Shawnees would have overtaken us
by this time had they found our trail on the Kentucky
shore. Common sense told me that for the
remainder of our journey we would, at worst, be
compelled to avoid small scouting-parties that had
no intimation of our presence on the Big Sandy.</p>
<p>But so many gruesome pranks had been played
by Fate that I was growing superstitious. And I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
feared lest the girl should be snatched from me at
the last moment, just as safety was almost within
sight. I slept poorly that night and what little rest
I did obtain was along toward morning.</p>
<p>The girl awoke me; and I felt my face burning
as I beheld her standing there, staring down accusingly,
the hunting-shirt spread across my chest. I
sprang to my feet and slipped into the shirt, which
was made like a coat, and waited for her to speak.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;ve been sleeping cold,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nay. Very warm,&#8221; I replied, becoming busy
with my moccasins.</p>
<p>&#8220;After this I will keep awake nights.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not need it. I always take it off at night
It makes me too warm.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You lie most beautifully, Basdel.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;How is the arm this morning?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Much better. But you must be more honest
with me. You must not lie any more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re making a mountain out of a hunting-shirt.
It is too warm to wear at night in this mild
weather.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hopeless. Of course it is not too warm
in the warm sunshine.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was glad to let it go at that. And there was
no warm sunshine this morning. The heavens were
overcast with gray cold clouds that rode high and
brought wind rather than rain. We missed the sun.
Town-dwellers can never know the degree of dependence
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
the forest wanderer places on the sunlight
for his comfort and good cheer. Despair becomes
gaiety under the genial rays. It is not surprising
the sun should be the greatest of all mysteries to the
Indians, and therefore their greatest medicine or
god.</p>
<p>We ate of the venison and mush and started for
the river. The distance was not great, but the way
was very rough, and there were no more blazed
trees to guide us, the surveyors&#8217; trace passing below
us and closer to the shore. But I was familiar with
the lay of the land and it was impossible for me to
go far wrong as long as all streams flowed into the
Ohio and we crossed at right angles with their
general course.</p>
<p>I carried the kettle slung on my rifle and with my
right hand gave the girl aid when the path became
unusually difficult. A wrenched ankle would leave
us as helpless as a broken leg. It required three
hours of painful effort to bring us to the Sandy.</p>
<p>I found a fording and carried her across to the
east shore and soon located a trader&#8217;s trace. She
never dreamed that her father often had traveled
along this faint path in his visits to the Ohio Indians.
Now that the footing was easier she had time to
gaze about, and the aspect depressed her.</p>
<p>The immense hills of sandrock were worn into
deep and gloomy ravines by the streams. In the
walls of the ravines black holes gaped, for caves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span>
were almost as numerous as springs. To encourage
a lighter mood I explained that these very caves
made the country an ideal place for hiding from the
Indians.</p>
<p>She broke into my talk by moaning:</p>
<p>&#8220;May the good God help us! See that!&#8221;</p>
<p>She was pointing to a dark opening across the
river. This framed the face of the devil. For a
moment I was sadly startled, then laughed hysterically
in relief.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a bear, with a white or gray marking on his
face,&#8221; I explained. &#8220;He is harmless. See! He&#8217;s
finished looking us over and goes back into his den.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the effect of the shock to her nerves did not
wear off for some time. To prepare her against
more glimpses of bruin I told her how the broken
nature of the country made it a favorite region for
bears, and that it had been long known along the
border as a famous hunting-ground for the big
creatures.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel just as if it was the guardian spirit of an
evil place, that it is spying on us and plotting to
harm us,&#8221; she confessed.</p>
<p>Whenever the trace permitted I swung aside from
the river and took to the ridges. The tops of these
were covered with chestnuts and their sides with
oaks. More than once on such détours I sighted
furtive furry forms slipping away from their feast
on the fallen nuts, but Patricia&#8217;s gaze was not sufficiently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span>
trained to detect them; and she wandered
through the groves without knowing we were literally
surrounded by bears.</p>
<p>While a wild country, it was relieved by many
beautiful touches. Such were the tulip-trees, or
yellow poplar. Many of them towered a hundred
feet with scarcely a limb to mar the wand-like symmetry
of the six-foot boles. Scarcely less inspiring
were the cucumber-trees, or mountain magnolias,
which here reached the perfection of growth.</p>
<p>Scattered among these tall ones were white and
yellow oaks; and they would be considered giants
if standing alone. These were the serene gods of
the forest, and they had a quieting influence on my
companion. It was with regret that I led her back
along the rough shore of the river.</p>
<p>I shot a young bear, but Patricia displayed a foolish
repugnance and would eat none of it. Later in
the day I killed a deer with such a minute charge of
powder as emphatically to establish my excellence
as a marksman for that one shot at least. We were
nearly three days in making the Tug Fork of the
Sandy.</p>
<p>The girl bore the hardships well. The wound on
her arm healed rapidly, and whatever she actually
suffered was mental rather than physical. Our
kettle proved second only to my rifle in importance,
and if the fare lacked the savor of salt our appetites
made up for the deficit. When we reached the Tug
we were in the region celebrated for Colonel Andrew
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
Lewis&#8217; &#8220;Sandy Creek Voyage of Fifty-six,&#8221; as it
was styled with grim facetiousness.</p>
<p>It was one instance when Colonel Lewis failed of
carrying out an enterprise against the Indians. It
was a retaliatory raid against the Shawnees and his
force was composed of whites and Cherokees; and
his lack of success was due largely to the inefficiency
of the guides who undertook to pilot him to the
mouth of the Sandy. I told the girl of the expedition
as it was lacking in horrible details, and with
other carefully selected narratives tried to keep her
from brooding.</p>
<p>She seldom mentioned her father, and when she
did it was usually connected with some phase of life
over the mountains. I believe that she was so
thankful to know he escaped the torture that his
death lost much of poignancy. Only once did she
revert to his taking off, and then to ask:</p>
<p>&#8220;Was there a single chance for him to escape?&#8221;</p>
<p>And I emphatically declared he never had the
ghost of a chance from the moment he fell into
Black Hoof&#8217;s hands.</p>
<p>Another ruse to keep her mind engaged was to
trace out our course with a stick on a patch of bare
earth. I showed how we should travel to the north
fork of the Sandy and then strike to the head of
Bluestone, and follow it nearly to the mouth before
leaving it to cross New River; then a short journey
to the Greenbriar and Howard&#8217;s Creek.</p>
<p>Had I had any choice I should have preferred to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
take her over the mountains to Salem, but my time
was not my own and it was imperative that I leave
her at the first place of safety and be about Governor
Dunmore&#8217;s business. My decision to make
Howard&#8217;s Creek was strengthened by an adventure
which befell us near the end of our first day on the
Tug. We were casting about for a place to camp
when we came upon five Indians, three squaws and
two hunters.</p>
<p>Patricia was greatly frightened on beholding
them, and it was some time before I could make
her understand that they were friendly Delawares,
accompanied by their women, and not painted nor
equipped for war. After calming her I addressed
them and learned they were from White Eye&#8217;s village.
They were afraid to go near the settlements.</p>
<p>Many &#8220;Long Knives,&#8221; as they called the Virginia
militia, were flocking to the Great Levels of the
Greenbriar, and a forward movement of a whole
army was shortly to be expected. As the presence
of a large force of our riflemen so near Howard&#8217;s
Creek would insure the safety of that settlement
I knew it to be the proper ending of our journey.</p>
<p>I induced Patricia to remain in camp with the
Indians while I went out and shot a bear. The
bear was very fat and I gave all the meat to the
natives, for which they were grateful. One
of them had a smoothbore, but no powder. I could
spare him none.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>Patricia was now convinced the Indians would
not harm us, but she would not consent to making
camp near them. We walked several more miles before
she was willing to stop and cook the kettle.</p>
<p>My tally-stick gave the thirteenth of September
as the date of our arrival at Howard&#8217;s Creek. The
settlers informed me I had lost a day somewhere on
the long journey and that it was the fourteenth.
Nearly all the young and unmarried men were off
to fight in Colonel Lewis&#8217; army, and many of the
heads of families, including Davis and Moulton.</p>
<p>Those who were left behind gave us a royal welcome.
Uncle Dick, the aged one, fell to sharpening
his long knife with renewed vigor. Patricia and I
had been counted as dead. Dale&#8217;s death had been
reported by young Cousin, and it caused no great
amount of sorrow. The girl was never allowed to
suspect this indifference. In reply to my eager
inquiries I was told that Shelby Cousin was at the
Great Levels, serving as a scout.</p>
<p>For once Howard&#8217;s Creek felt safe. With nothing
to worry about the men and women became garrulous
as crows. The children played &#8220;Lewis&#8217;
Army&#8221; from sunrise to sunset. The Widow McCabe
swore she would put on a hunting-shirt and
breeches and go to war. The passing of men between
the levels and the creek resulted in some
news and many rumors. The meeting-place at the
levels was called Camp Union. Colonel Lewis, pursuant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
to orders from Governor Dunmore, had commenced
assembling the Augusta, Botetourt and Fincastle
County troops at the levels on August twenty-seven.
Cornstalk&#8217;s spies had served him well!</p>
<p>His Lordship was to lead an army, raised from
the northwest counties and from the vicinity of
Fort Pitt, down the Ohio and unite with Colonel
Lewis at the mouth of the Great Kanawha. Colonel
Charles Lewis, with some Augusta and Botetourt
troops, had left Camp Union on September
sixth to drive the cattle and four hundred pack-animals
to the mouth of the Elk, where he was to
make canoes for transporting provisions to the
Ohio.</p>
<p>The main army had marched from Camp Union
on the twelfth, although Colonel Lewis had received
a letter from Dunmore, urging that the rendezvous
be changed to the mouth of the Little Kanawha.
Colonel Lewis had replied it was impossible to
alter his line of march.</p>
<p>From a fellow sent out to round up stray bullocks
I learned the army would avoid the deep gorge and
falls in the river by marching ten miles inland and
parallel to the east bank, joining Colonel Charles
Lewis at the Elk.</p>
<p>By another man I was told how the militia men
were given to shooting away their precious ammunition,
and how the colonel had warned that unless
the practise ceased no more powder would be given
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
out. That the Indians were active and not afraid
of the troops was evidenced by an attack on Stewart&#8217;s
Fort, only four miles from Camp Union. And
this, before the troops marched.</p>
<p>Colonel William Christian was in command of
the rear-guard, and his men were much disgruntled
at the thought of not being in the forefront of the
fighting. What was most significant to me, although
only an incident in the estimation of the
men left at Howard&#8217;s Creek, was the attack made
by two Indians on two of Lewis&#8217; scouts, Clay and
Coward by name.</p>
<p>The scouts had separated and one of the Indians
fired on and killed Clay. Thinking him to be alone,
the Indians ran to get his scalp, and Coward at a
distance of a hundred yards shot him dead. Coward
then ran back toward the line of march and
the surviving Indian fled down the Great Kanawha
to inform the Shawnee towns that the Long Knives
were coming.</p>
<p>I lost no time in securing a horse and a supply
of powder and in hurrying to say good-by to Patricia.
She was very sober when I told her I was
off to overtake the army. Placing both hands on
my shoulders, she said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Basdel, I know you&#8217;ve forgiven all the disagreeable
things I&#8217;ve said to you. I will wait here until
I hear from you. I will pray that you have an equal
chance with the other brave men.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will come back and take you over the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If you will only come back you may take me
where you will, dear lad, even if it be deeper into
the wilderness,&#8221; she softly promised.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Davis bustled out of the cabin and energetically
shooed the curious youngsters away.</p>
<p>And now I was riding away to battle, riding
right joyously over the chestnut ridges and through
the thick laurel, through stretches of pawpaw,
beech and flowering poplar, with the pea-vine and
buffalo grass soft underfoot. And my heart was as
blithe as the mocking-bird&#8217;s and there was no
shadow of tomahawk or scalping-knife across my
path.</p>
<p>I knew the destiny of the border was soon to be
settled, that it hinged on the lean, leather-faced
riflemen ahead, but there was nothing but sunshine
and glory for me in that September day as I hastened
to overtake the grim-faced man who believed
His Lordship, John Murray, fourth Earl of Dunmore,
Viscount Fincastle, Baron of Blair, Monlin
and of Tillimet, was Virginia&#8217;s last royal governor.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE SHADOWS VANISH</h3>
</div>

<p>I followed the river, the cord of the bow, and
made good time where the army would have had
difficulty to get through. A dozen miles below the
falls and near the mouth of Kelly&#8217;s Creek, where
Walter Kelly was killed by the Indians early in
August, I came upon a scout named Nooney. We
were on the west bank and the river was two hundred
yards wide at that point. Nooney begged
some tobacco and pointed out a fording-place and
gave me the &#8220;parole.&#8221; This, very fittingly, was
&#8220;Kanawha.&#8221; He said I would speedily make the
camp and that Colonel Lewis was with the first
troops.</p>
<p>I lost no time in crossing and had barely cleared
the river-bank before I was held up by an outpost.
This fellow knew nothing of military red-tape. He
was plain militia, a good man in a fight, but inclined
to resent discipline. He grinned affably as
I broke through the woods and lowered his rifle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Gim&#8217;me some tobacker,&#8221; he demanded good-naturedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I suppose you&#8217;d want the parole,&#8221; I replied, fishing
out a twist of Virginia leaf.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got that. It&#8217;s &#8216;Kanawha.&#8217; What I want is
tobacker. Don&#8217;t hurry. Le&#8217;s talk. I&#8217;m lonesome
as one bug all alone in a buffler robe. See any
footin&#8217; over &#8217;cross? I&#8217;m gittin&#8217; tired o&#8217; this outpost
business. All foolishness. We&#8217;ll know when
we strike th&#8217; red devils. No need o&#8217; havin&#8217; some
one tell us. Your hoss looks sorter peaked. S&#8217;pose
we&#8217;ll have a mess of a fight soon? We boys come
along to fight, not to stand like stockade-timbers
out here all alone.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him I had important news for Colonel
Lewis and must not tarry. He took it rather ill
because I would not tell him my news, then tried
to make me promise I would come back and impart
it. I equivocated and led my horse on toward the
camp, concealed from view of the river-bank by a
ribbon of woods. The first man I met was Davis,
and the honest fellow was so rejoiced to see me
that he dropped his gun and took both my hands
and stood there with his mouth working, but unable
to say a word. Big tears streamed down his face.</p>
<p>I hurriedly related my adventures, and his joy
was treble when he heard that Patricia was safe at
Howard&#8217;s Creek.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shelby Cousin shot and kilt Dale. He told us
&#8217;bout that. Ericus thought he knew it all. Wal,
them that lives longest learns th&#8217; most,&#8221; he philosophically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
observed. &#8220;Powerful glad to see you.
We&#8217;ll be seein&#8217; more of each other, I take it. How&#8217;s
my woman? Good. She&#8217;s a right forward, capable
woman, if I do say it. Moulton&#8217;s out on a
scout. Silent sort of a cuss these days from thinkin&#8217;
&#8217;bout his woman an&#8217; th&#8217; children. But a rare hand
in a mess.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And Cousin?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Morris, that feller acts like he was reg&#8217;lar
happy. Laughs a lot, only it don&#8217;t sound nat&#8217;ral.
He&#8217;s a hellion at scoutin&#8217;. Poor Baby Kirst! I
must &#8217;low it&#8217;s best for him to be wiped out, but it&#8217;s
too bad he couldn&#8217;t &#8217;a&#8217; made his last fight along
with us. There&#8217;s th&#8217; colonel in his shirt-sleeves
smokin&#8217; his pipe.&#8221;</p>
<p>I passed on to where Lewis was sitting on a log.
It was fearfully hot, as the high hills on each side
of the river shut out the free air and made the camp
an oven. On recognizing me, the colonel&#8217;s eyes
flickered with surprise, as the report of my capture
had spread far. He rose and took my hand and
quietly said:</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew they couldn&#8217;t hold you unless they
killed you on the spot. What about Miss Dale?&#8221;</p>
<p>I informed him of her safety and his face lighted
wonderfully.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s good!&#8221; he softly exclaimed. &#8220;A beautiful
young woman, the kind that Virginia is always
proud of. Ericus Dale was lucky to die without
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span>
being tortured. Now for your news; for you must
be bringing some.&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him of the mighty gathering at Chillicothe
and of the influx of the fierce Ottawas. Lost Sister&#8217;s
warning to me to keep clear of the Great
Kanawha impressed him deeply. It convinced him,
I think, that the astute Cornstalk had planned to
attack the army before it could cross the Ohio, and
that the Shawnees on learning of the assembling at
the levels knew the advance must be down the
Kanawha. The Indian who escaped after Clay was
killed was back on the Scioto by this time. After
musing over it for a bit he insisted that it did not
necessarily follow the attack would be in force.</p>
<p>&#8220;That was Cornstalk&#8217;s first plan. But now he
knows Governor Dunmore has an army at the
mouth of the Little Kanawha. He may choose to
attack him instead of me. I hope not, but there&#8217;s
a strong chance he&#8217;ll do that while making a feint
to fool me, and then float down the river and give
me a real battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>He kindly offered to attach me to one of the companies
as sergeant, with the possibility of appointing
me an ensign, but I preferred to act as scout and
enjoy more independence of action.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the trouble,&#8221; he remarked. &#8220;All these
fellows want to be scouts and range the woods free
of discipline. They want to whip the Indians but
they want to do it their own way. They persist in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span>
wasting ammunition, and it now looks as if we
would go into battle with less than one-fourth of a
pound of powder per man.</p>
<p>&#8220;If any man speaks up and says he is the best
marksman in Virginia then every man within hearing
challenges him to prove it. And they&#8217;ll step one
side and have a shooting-match, even if they know
Cornstalk&#8217;s army is within a couple of miles of us.
They&#8217;re used to bear- and deer-meat. They don&#8217;t
want to eat bullock-meat. I&#8217;ll admit the beef is a
bit tough. And every morning some of them break
the rules by stealing out to kill game. This not only
wastes powder, but keeps the outposts alarmed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before I was dismissed I asked about Cousin.
The colonel&#8217;s face became animated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, the young man with the sad history? He&#8217;s
out on a scout. That fellow is absolutely fearless.
I am surprised every time he lives to return to
make a report. It&#8217;s useless to lay down a route for
him to scout; he prowls where he will. But he&#8217;s
valuable, and we let him have his own way.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the next day we marched to the mouth of the
Elk where Colonel Charles Lewis was completing
arrangements for transporting the supplies down
the river. While at that camp I went on my first
scout and found Indian tracks. One set of them
measured fourteen inches in length. The men went
and looked at the signs before they would accept
my measurements.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>The camp was extremely busy, for we all knew
the crisis was drawing close. Our armorer worked
early and late unbreeching the guns having wet
charges. Three brigades of horses were sent back
to Camp Union for more flour. I went with
Mooney on a scout up Coal River and we found
Indian signs four miles from camp. Other scouts
were sent down the Kanawha and up the Elk.</p>
<p>On returning, I found Cousin impatiently waiting
for me to come in. He had changed and his
bearing puzzled me. He was given to laughing
loudly at the horse-play of the men, yet his eyes
never laughed. I took him outside the camp and
without any circumlocution related the facts concerning
his sister and Kirst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me again that part &#8217;bout how she died,&#8221; he
quietly requested when I had finished. I did so.
He commented:</p>
<p>&#8220;For killing that redskin I owe you more&#8217;n I
would if you&#8217;d saved my life a thousand times. So
little sister is dead. No, not that. Now that woman
is dead I have my little sister back again. I
took on with this army so&#8217;s I could reach the Scioto
towns. To think that Kirst got way up there! I
&#8217;low he had a man&#8217;s fight to die in. That&#8217;s the way.
Morris, I&#8217;m obleeged to you. I&#8217;ll always remember
her words &#8217;bout sendin&#8217; a little sister to me. Now
I&#8217;ve got two of &#8217;em. We won&#8217;t talk no more &#8217;bout
it.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>With that he turned and hurried into the woods.</p>
<p>The men continued firing their guns without
having obtained permission, and Colonel Lewis was
thoroughly aroused to stop the practise. He directed
that his orders of the fifteenth be read at the
head of each company, with orders for the captains
to inspect their men&#8217;s stock of ammunition and
report those lacking powder. This reduced the
waste, but there was no stopping the riflemen from
popping away at bear or deer once they were out
of sight of their officers.</p>
<p>I had hoped Cousin would return and be my companion
on the next scout, but as he failed to show
up I set off with Mooney for a second trip up the
Coal. This time we discovered signs of fifteen
Indians making toward the Kanawha below the
camp. We returned with the news and found a
wave of drunkenness had swept the camp during
our absence.</p>
<p>The sutlers were ordered to bring no more liquor
into camp, and to sell from the supply on hand only
on a captain&#8217;s written order. This served to sober
the offenders speedily. The scouts sent down the
Kanawha returned and reported two fires and five
Indians within fifteen miles of the Ohio. It was
plain that the Indians were dogging our steps day
and night, and the men were warned not to straggle.</p>
<p>We were at the Elk Camp from the twenty-fourth
to the thirtieth, and on the latter date the canoemen
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
loaded their craft, and the pack-horse men and bullock-drivers
drew two days&#8217; rations and started
down-river. It rained for three days and on October
second we were camped near the mouth of the
Coal. It was there that Cousin appeared, a Mingo
scalp hanging at his belt. He informed Colonel
Lewis he had been to the mouth of the river, making
the down-trip in a canoe, and that as yet no Indians
had crossed except small bands of scouts.</p>
<p>Breaking camp, we encountered rich bottom-lands,
difficult to traverse because of the rain.
Every mile or two there were muddy creeks, and the
pack-horses were nearly worn out. Several desertions
were now reported from the troops, a hostility
to discipline rather than cowardice being the incentive.
Another trouble was the theft of supplies.</p>
<p>As we advanced down the river signs of small
bands of Indians became numerous; scarcely a scout
returned without reporting some. I saw nothing of
Cousin until the sixth of October, and as we were
finishing an eight-mile march through long defiles
and across small runs and were entering the bottom
which extends for four miles to the Ohio. The
first that I knew he was with us was when he walked
at my side and greeted:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a screamin&#8217; big fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>He offered no explanation of his absence and I
asked him nothing. It had required five weeks to
march eleven hundred men one hundred and sixty
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
miles and to convey the necessary supplies the same
distance.</p>
<p>As we scouts in the lead entered the bottom Cousin
called my attention to the high-water marks on the
trees. Some of these measured ten feet. The
Point itself is high. From it we had a wide view
of the Ohio and Kanawha, up- and down-stream.
It was Cousin who discovered a writing made fast
to a tree, calling attention to a paper concealed in
the hollow at the base of the tree. We fished it out
and found it was addressed to Colonel Lewis.
Cousin and I took it to him. Before opening it, he
gave Cousin a shrewd glance and remarked:</p>
<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you back, young man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If I&#8217;ve read the signs right I &#8217;low I&#8217;m glad to
git back,&#8221; was the grave reply.</p>
<p>The letter was from Governor Dunmore, and he
wrote to complain because our colonel had not
joined him at the Little Kanawha. He now informed
our commander he had dropped down to the
mouth of the Big Hockhocking, and we were expected
to join him there. After frowning over the
communication, Colonel Lewis read it aloud to some
of his officers and expressed himself very forcefully.
It was soon camp gossip, and every man
was free to discuss it.</p>
<p>Much anger was expressed against Governor
Dunmore. And it did seem absurd to ask our army
to move up the Ohio some sixty miles when such a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span>
tedious maneuver would lead us farther from the
Indian towns than we were while at the Point. Had
the order been given for the army to go to the
Hockhocking there would have been many desertions.</p>
<p>I learned later that the letter was brought to the
Point by Simon Kenton and Simon Girty, who with
Michael Cresap were serving as scouts with Dunmore.
While the camp was busily criticizing the
governor our scouts from the Elk came in and reported
seeing Indians hunting buffalo. When
within six miles of the Point, they found a plowshare,
some surveying-instruments, a shirt, a light
blue coat and a human under jaw-bone.</p>
<p>Shelby Cousin said the dead man was Thomas
Hoog, who with two or three of his men were reported
killed by the Indians in the preceding April
while making improvements. Cousin insisted his
death had been due to wild animals or an accident,
after which the animals had dragged his remains
into the woods. He argued that an Indian would
never have left the coat or the instruments.</p>
<p>We passed the seventh and eighth of the month
in making the camp sanitary and in building a
shelter for the supplies yet to arrive down the river.
Preparations also went ahead for moving the army
across the Ohio. Most of the scouts were sent out
to hunt up lost beeves, while a sergeant and squad
were despatched with canoes to the Elk after flour.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>Three men came in from the Elk and reported
that Colonel Christian was camped there with two
hundred and twenty men, that he had only sixteen
kettles, and was fearing his men would be ill from
eating too much roast meat &#8220;without broth.&#8221; On
the eighth there arrived more letters from Governor
Dunmore, in which His Lordship expressed his
surprise and annoyance because of our failure to
appear at the Hockhocking.</p>
<p>This time Colonel Lewis was quite open in expressing
his disgust at the governor&#8217;s lack of
strategy. The Kanawha was the gate to Augusta,
Botetourt and Fincastle Counties. To leave it and
move up-river would leave the way open for the red
army to stream into Virginia and work its savagery
while the colonials were cooped up on the Ohio or
hunting Indian wigwams in the wilderness.</p>
<p>In the package was a letter to our colonel from
Colonel Adam Stephens, second in command to His
Excellency, which was given wide publicity. Colonel
Stephens reported very disagreeable news from
Boston. It was to the effect that General Gage had
fired on the people at Cambridge. Later we learned
that while some gun-powder and two cannon had
been seized by His Majesty&#8217;s troops there had been
no massacre of the provincials. But while the
rumor remained uncontradicted it caused high excitement
and great rage.</p>
<p>On the evening of the ninth Cousin and I were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span>
ordered out to scout up the river beyond Old Town
Creek. Our camp was near the junction of the
Kanawha and the Ohio, almost at the tip of the
Point. About a fourth of a mile to the east is
Crooked Creek, a very narrow stream at that season
of the year, with banks steep and muddy. It skirts
the base of some low hills and flows nearly south in
emptying into the Kanawha. Half-way between our
camp and Old Town Creek, which empties into the
Ohio, is a small stretch of marsh-land extending
north and south, with bottom-lands on each side.</p>
<p>Cousin and I planned to keep along the Ohio
shore until a few miles above Old Town Creek, when
we would separate, one returning along our course
to keep an eye on the river, the other circling to the
east and swinging back through the low hills
drained by Crooked Creek. This double reconnaissance
should reveal any spies.</p>
<p>The men were very anxious to cross the river and
come in contact with the Indians. They believed
they would have the allied tribes within their grasp
once they reached the Scioto. They were cheered
by the report that the army would cross on the morrow.
One tall Watauga boy boastfully proclaimed
that all the Shawnees and Mingos beyond the Ohio
wouldn&#8217;t &#8220;make more&#8217;n a breakfast for us.&#8221; Davis,
because a man of family and more conservative,
insisted it would be a &#8220;pretty tough chunk of a
fight.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>This was the optimistic spirit Cousin and I left
behind us when we set out at sunset. Cousin was in
a new mood. There was a certain wild gaiety,
rather a ferocious gaiety, in his bearing. His
drawn face had lost some of the hard lines and
looked almost boyish and his eyes were feverishly
alight. He seemed possessed of superabundant
physical strength, and in pure muscular wantonness
went out of his way to leap the fallen timbers which
littered the shore.</p>
<p>As darkness increased he ceased his wild play and
became the prince of scouts. We advanced most
leisurely, for we had all night if we cared to stay
out. We halted when abreast of the marsh-land and
seated ourselves on the banks of the Ohio and
watched the starlight find a mirror in the water.
After a protracted silence he abruptly asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;My sister said she was sendin&#8217; me a new sister,
you say?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Those were her words.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wish she could know to-night I ain&#8217;t needin&#8217;
any new sister. Wish she could know right now
that she&#8217;s always been my sister. When I reckoned
I&#8217;d lost her I was just mistook. She was just
gone away for a little while. She found a mighty
hard an&#8217; rough trace to travel. I &#8217;low the Almighty
will have to give her many belts afore He smooths
out the path in her mind. I &#8217;low it&#8217;ll take a heap o&#8217;
presents to make up for the burrs an&#8217; briers an&#8217;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
sharp stones she had to foot it over. Thank God
she died white!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amen to that!&#8221;</p>
<p>After another silence he asked:</p>
<p>&#8220;You &#8217;low she&#8217;s with daddy an&#8217; mammy?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mighty comfortin&#8217; to figger on,&#8221; he
slowly mused. &#8220;Much like a younker gittin&#8217; mighty
tired an&#8217; goin&#8217; back home to rest. Daddy an&#8217; mammy
will do a heap to make it up to her for what she
had to go through. Yes, I can count on &#8217;em, even
if the Almighty happened to be too busy to notice
her when she first crossed the border.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dear lad! He meant no irreverence.</p>
<p>The night was calm and sounds carried easily.
We had passed beyond where we could hear the
men singing and merry-making in camp, but the
uneasy movements of a turkey and the stealthy retreat
of a deer seemed very close at hand. The
soft pad-pad of a woods cat approached within a
few feet before the creature caught the scent, and
the retreat was marked by a series of crashings
through the undergrowth.</p>
<p>After a while we rose and continued up the
river.</p>
<p>&#8220;No Injuns along here,&#8221; murmured Cousin.</p>
<p>We reached Old Town Creek and crossed it without
discovering any signs of the enemy; nor were we
looking for anything more serious than a stray
scout or two. We went nearly two miles above the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span>
creek and turned back after deciding we would
separate at the creek, he taking the hills route and
I following the river. We reached the creek and
he was about to leave me when we both heard a
new note, a splashing noise, very faint. Our hands
met in a mutual desire to grab an arm and enforce
attention.</p>
<p>&#8220;No fish made it,&#8221; I whispered.</p>
<p>&#8220;No fish,&#8221; he agreed. &#8220;There!&#8221;</p>
<p>The splashing came from across the several hundred
yards of the Ohio&#8217;s deep and silent current.
It was repeated until it became almost continuous,
and it gradually grew louder.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rafts!&#8221; shrilly whispered Cousin.</p>
<p>&#8220;They are paddling fast.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No! But there are many rafts,&#8221; he corrected.</p>
<p>We retreated up-stream a short distance and concealed
ourselves in a deep growth. To the sound of
poles and paddles was added the murmuring of guttural
voices. Then for a climax a raft struck
against the bank and a low voice speaking Shawnee
gave some sharp orders.</p>
<p>&#8220;One!&#8221; counted Cousin.</p>
<p>As he spoke another raft took the shore, and then
they grounded so rapidly that it was impossible to
count them. Orders were given, and the Indians
worked back from the river and proceeded to make
a night-camp. The landing had been made at the
mouth of the creek, but the savages had spread out,
and some of them were due east from us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a heap of &#8217;em!&#8221; whispered Cousin.
&#8220;Lucky for us they didn&#8217;t fetch any dawgs along,
or we&#8217;d be smelled out an&#8217; have to leg it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I hear squaws talking.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiss the devil if you don&#8217;t! There&#8217;s boys&#8217;
voices, too. They&#8217;ve fetched their squaws an&#8217; boys
along to knock the wounded an&#8217; dyin&#8217; in the head.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then that means they feel sure of winning.&#8221;</p>
<p>And my heart began thumping until I feared its
beating would be audible at a distance. And before
my inner gaze appeared a picture of Lewis&#8217; army
defeated and many victims being given over to the
stake.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep shet!&#8221; cautioned Cousin. &#8220;There it is
again! A Mingo talkin&#8217;, a Seneca, I&#8217;d say&mdash;Hear
that jabber! Delaware&mdash;Wyandot&mdash;Taway
(Ottawa). With a blanket o&#8217; Shawnee pow-wow.
By heavens, Morris! This is Cornstalk&#8217;s whole
force. They&#8217;ve learned that Dunmore is at the
Hockhockin&#8217; an&#8217; will be j&#8217;inin&#8217; up with Lewis any
day, an&#8217; old Cornstalk thinks to lick Lewis afore
Dunmore&#8217;s men can git along!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was now after midnight, and I knew we should
be back at camp and warning Colonel Lewis of his
peril. I knew from my last talk with him that he
did not expect to meet the Indians in any numbers
until we had crossed the Ohio. Our failure to find
any Indians at the Point and our prospects for an
immediate crossing conduced to this belief.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span></p>
<p>The day before all the scouts had been instructed
as to our maneuvers once we crossed the river and
were searching for ambushes. It was terrible to
think of our army asleep only three miles away. I
urged an immediate return, but Cousin coolly refused
to go until he had reconnoitered further.</p>
<p>&#8220;You stay here till I&#8217;ve sneaked down to the
mouth o&#8217; the creek,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;&#8217;Twon&#8217;t do
for both of us to git killed an&#8217; leave no one to take
the word to Lewis.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But why run any risk?&#8221; I anxiously demanded;
for I feared he had some mad prank in mind which
would betray our presence and perhaps stop our
warning to the army.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must l&#8217;arn somethin&#8217; as to how many o&#8217; the
red skunks there be,&#8221; he replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;To venture near their camp will mean discovery.
They&#8217;re very wide-awake.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t goin&#8217; near their camp,&#8221; he growled in
irritation. &#8220;I want to look over them rafts. I can
tell from them how many warriors come over, or
pretty close to it.&#8221;</p>
<p>He slipped away and left me to do the hardest of
the work&mdash;the work of waiting. It seemed a very
long time before I heard the bushes rustle. I drew
my ax, but a voice whispering &#8220;Richmond,&#8221; the
parole for the night, composed me. Feeling his
way to my side he gravely informed me:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s seventy-eight or nine rafts an&#8217; a few
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span>
canoes. It&#8217;s goin&#8217; to be a fine piece o&#8217; fightin&#8217;. At
least there&#8217;s a thousand warriors on this side an&#8217;
a lot o&#8217; squaws an&#8217; boys.&#8221;</p>
<p>I estimated our army at eleven hundred and I
thanked God they were all frontiersmen.</p>
<p>Cousin now was as eager to go as I; and leaving
our hiding-place, we worked north until we felt
safe to make a détour to the east. Our progress
was slow as there was no knowing how far the
Indian scouts were ranging. Once we were forced
to remain flat on our stomachs while a group of
warriors passed within a dozen feet of us, driving
to their camp some strayed beeves from the high
rolling bottom-lands to the east. When the last of
them had passed I observed with great alarm a
thinning out of the darkness along the eastern skyline.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good God! We&#8217;ll be too late!&#8221; I groaned.
&#8220;Let&#8217;s fire our guns and give the alarm!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet!&#8221; snarled my companion. &#8220;I must be
in the thick o&#8217; that fight. We&#8217;re too far east to git
to camp in a hustle. We must sneak atween the
hills an&#8217; that small slash (Virginian for marsh).
Foller me.&#8221;</p>
<p>We changed our course so as to avoid the low
hills drained by Crooked Creek, and made after the
warriors. About an hour before sunrise we were
at the head of the marsh, and in time to witness
the first act of the day&#8217;s great drama. Two men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span>
were working out of the fallen timber, and Cousin
threw up his double-barrel rifle. I checked him,
saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t! They&#8217;re white!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Renegades!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;John Sevier&#8217;s younger brother, Valentine.
T&#8217;other is Jim Robertson.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then Lewis knows. He sent &#8217;em to scout the
camp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re after game. James Shelby is sick with
the fever. Yesterday morning he asked them to
perch a turkey for him. Signal them. They know
nothing about the Indians!&#8221;</p>
<p>Cousin risked discovery by standing clear of the
bushes and waving his hat. &#8220;There comes two
more of &#8217;em!&#8221; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>This couple was some distance behind the
Watauga boys, but I recognized them. One was
James Mooney, my companion on the Coal River
scout. The other was Joseph Hughey.</p>
<p>I jumped out and stood beside Cousin and waved
my arms frantically. One of them caught the motion
and said something. The four paused and
stared at us. We made emphatic gestures for them
to fall back. At first they were slow to understand,
thinking, as Sevier told me afterward, that I was
pointing out some game. Then they turned to run,
Robertson and Sevier firing their rifles to the
woods to the north of us.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>These were the first guns fired in the battle of
Point Pleasant. From the woods came the noise of
a large body of men advancing. A ripple of shots
was sent after the hunters. Hughey and Mooney
halted and returned the fire. A streak of red some
distance ahead of the Shawnees&#8217; position, and close
to the river-bank, dropped Hughey dead. This
shot was fired by Tavenor Ross, a white man, who
was captured by the Indians when a boy and who
had grown up among them.</p>
<p>Mooney, Robertson and young Sevier were now
running for the camp, passing between the Ohio
bank and the marsh. We raced after them just as
a man named Hickey ran from the bushes and
joined them. The Indians kept up a scattering fire
and they made much noise as they spread out
through the woods in battle-line. They supposed
we were the scouts of an advancing army.</p>
<p>It is the only instance I know of where insubordination
saved any army from a surprise attack,
and possibly from defeat. To escape detection
while breaking the orders against foraging, the five
men named had stolen from the camp at an early
hour.</p>
<p>By the time Cousin and I passed the lower end
of the marsh small bodies of Indians were making
for the hills along Crooked Creek; others were following
down the Ohio inside the timber, while their
scouts raced recklessly after us to locate our line of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span>
battle. The scouts soon discovered that our army
was nowhere to be seen. Runners were instantly
sent back to inform Cornstalk he was missing a
golden opportunity by not attacking at once.</p>
<p>Mooney was the first to reach Colonel Lewis,
who was seated on a log in his shirt-sleeves, smoking
his pipe. Mooney shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;More&#8217;n four acres covered with Injuns at Old
Town Creek!&#8221;</p>
<p>Rising, but with no show of haste, Lewis called
to Cousin and me: &#8220;What about this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An attack in force, sir, I believe,&#8221; I panted.</p>
<p>He glanced at Cousin, who nodded and then
ducked away.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think you are mistaken,&#8221; the colonel coldly
remarked. &#8220;It must be a big scouting-party.&#8221; I
tried to tell him what Cousin and I had seen and
heard. But he ignored me and ordered the drums
to beat To Arms. But already the border men were
turning out and diving behind logs and rocks even
while the sleep still blurred their eyes.</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis ordered two columns of one hundred
and fifty men each to march forward and test
the strength of the enemy. The colonel&#8217;s brother
Charles led the Augusta line to the right. Colonel
William Fleming commanded the left&mdash;Botetourt
men. The two columns were about two hundred
yards apart, and their brisk and businesslike advance
did the heart good to behold.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_332' name='page_332'></a>332</span></p>
<p>No one as yet except the hunters and Cousin and
I realized the three hundred men were being sent
against the full force of the Ohio Indians. Colonel
Lewis resumed his seat and continued smoking.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re nervous, Morris. It can&#8217;t be more than
a large scouting-party, or they&#8217;d have chased you
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;They came over on seventy-eight rafts!&#8221; I
replied, turning to race after Colonel Charles Lewis&#8217;
column.</p>
<p>The Augusta men were now swinging in close to
Crooked Creek where it skirts the foot of the low
hills. As I drew abreast of the head of the column
we were fired upon by a large force of Indians, now
snugly ensconced behind trees and fallen timber
along the creek. We were then not more than a
quarter of a mile from camp. The first fire was
tremendously heavy and was quickly followed by a
second and third volley. The Augusta men reeled,
but quickly began returning the fire, the behavior
of the men being all that a commander could desire.
They were forced to give ground, however, as the
odds were heavy.</p>
<p>On our left crashed a volley as the Botetourt
men were fired on. Colonel Lewis ordered his men
to take cover, then turned to Captain Benjamin Harrison
and cried:</p>
<p>&#8220;This is no scouting-party! But my brother will
soon be sending reinforcements.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>He had hardly spoken before he spun half-way
around, a surprised expression on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m wounded,&#8221; he quietly said.</p>
<p>Then handing his rifle to a soldier, he called out
to his men:</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on and be brave!&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he began walking to the camp. I ran
to help him, but he motioned me back, saying:</p>
<p>&#8220;Your place is there. I&#8217;m all right.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I left him, a very brave soldier and a Christian
gentleman, to make his way alone while his very
minutes were numbered.</p>
<p>Half a dozen of our men were down and the
rest were slowly giving ground. Up to the time
Colonel Lewis left us I had seen very few Indians,
and only mere glimpses at that. Now they began
showing themselves as they crowded forward
through the timber, confident they were to slaughter
us. Above the noise of the guns, the yells and
shouts of red and white combatants, rose a deep
booming voice, that of Cornstalk, and he was shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be strong! Be strong! Push them into the
river!&#8221;</p>
<p>We dragged back our dead and wounded as with
a reckless rush the Indians advanced over logs and
rocks up to the very muzzles of our guns. But
although the Augusta line gave ground the men
were not suffering from panic, and the smashing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
volley poured into the enemy did great damage and
checked their mad onslaught.</p>
<p>Never before did red men make such a determined
charge. In an instant there were a score of
individual combats, backwoodsman and savage
being clinched in a death-struggle with ax and
knife. Now our line stiffened, and the very shock
of their attack seemed to hurl the Indians back.
Still we would have been forced back to the camp
and must have suffered cruel losses if not for the
timely reinforcements brought up on the run by
Colonel John Field, veteran of Braddock&#8217;s and Pontiac&#8217;s
Wars.</p>
<p>He led Augusta and Botetourt men, for it was no
longer possible to keep the two lines under their
respective commanders, nor did any captain for the
rest of the day command his own company as a
unit. With the coming up of Colonel Field the
Indians immediately gave ground, then charged
most viciously as our men pursued. This maneuver
was one of Cornstalk&#8217;s cunning tactics, the alternate
advance and retreat somewhat confusing our men.</p>
<p>The second attack was repulsed and the riflemen
slowly gained more ground. The firing on our
left was now very heavy and Colonel Field directed
me to learn how the fight there was progressing.
Some of our fellows were screaming that Fleming&#8217;s
column was being driven in, and our colonel had
no intention of being cut off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span></p>
<p>As I started toward the river I could hear Cornstalk
exhorting: &#8220;Shoot straight! Lie close!
Fight and be strong!&#8221;</p>
<p>As I withdrew from the right column I had a
chance to get a better idea of the battle. The Indians
lined the base of the hills bordered by Crooked
Creek, and were posted on all the heights to shoot
any whites trying to swim either the Ohio or the
Kanawha. On the opposite side of the Ohio and,
as I later learned on the south bank of the Kanawha,
red forces had been stationed in anticipation of our
army being routed.</p>
<p>As I neared the Botetourt men I could hear between
volleys the Indians shouting in unison:</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive the white dogs over!&#8221; meaning across
the river.</p>
<p>The Botetourt men were well posted and considerably
in advance of the right column, as they
had given but little ground while the right was
retiring after Lewis was shot. At no time did
either column fight at a range of more than twenty
yards, and when I crawled among Fleming&#8217;s men
the range was not more than six yards, while here
and there in the deeper growth were hand-to-hand
struggles.</p>
<p>&#8220;A big chunk of a fight!&#8221; screamed a shrill voice,
and Cousin was beside me, wearing a brilliant scarlet
jacket. As he was crawling by me I caught him
by the heel and dragged him back.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You fool! Take that coat off!&#8221; I yelled. For
the vivid splotch of color made him a tempting target
for every Indian gun. And the Shawnees were
skilful marksmen even if less rapid than the whites
because of their inability to clean their fouled weapons.</p>
<p>Cousin drew up his leg to kick free, then smiled
sweetly and said:</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my big day, Morris. Don&#8217;t go for to meddle
with my medicine. Everything&#8217;s all right at
last. I&#8217;ve found the long trace that leads to my
little sister. She&#8217;s waitin&#8217; to put her hand in mine,
as she used to do on Keeney&#8217;s Knob.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that he suddenly jerked his leg free and
sprang to his feet and streaked toward the savages,
his blood-curdling panther-screech penetrating the
heavier vibrations of the battle.</p>
<p>He was lost to view in the brush and I had my
work to do. I kept along the edge of the timber,
and answered many anxious queries as to the fate of
the right column. I reassured them, but did not
deem it wise to tell of Colonel Lewis&#8217; wound. I
found the column quite close to the river and by the
stubborn resistance it was meeting I knew the Indians
were strongly posted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you whistle now?&#8221; they kept howling
in concert, and referring to our fifes which were
still.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll kill you all, and then go and speak to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
your big chief (Dunmore),&#8221; was one of their
promises.</p>
<p>And there were other things shouted, foul
epithets, which I am ashamed to admit could only
have been learned from the whites. And repeatedly
did they encourage one another and seek to intimidate
us by yelling:</p>
<p>&#8220;Drive the white dogs over the river! Drive
them like cattle into the water!&#8221;</p>
<p>While I kept well covered and was completing
my reconnaissance I was horrified to see Colonel
Fleming walk into the clear ground. He fired at
an Indian who had showed himself for a moment
to make an insulting gesture. He got his man, and
the next second was struck by three balls, two passing
through his left arm and the third penetrating
his left breast.</p>
<p>He called out to his captains by name and sharply
ordered them to hold their ground while he went
to the rear to be patched up. He was answered by
hearty cheers, but his absence was to be keenly felt
by his officers. He started to work his way to the
Point, but the exertion of bending and dodging
from tree to stump sorely taxed him. I ran to his
aid just as Davis, of Howard&#8217;s Creek, sprang from
behind a log and seized his right arm. Between us
we soon had him back in camp and his shirt off.
The lung tissue had been forced through the wound
a finger&#8217;s length. He asked me to put it back. I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span>
attempted it and failed, whereat he did it himself
without any fuss.</p>
<p>On returning to the right column to make a belated
report to Colonel Field I ran across the body
of Mooney, my partner on several scouts. He had
been shot through the head. It may here be said
that nearly all the dead on both sides were shot
through the head or chest, indicating the accuracy
of marksmanship on both sides.</p>
<p>I found the Augusta men steadily pushing the
Indians back. But when they gave ground quickly,
as if in a panic, it was to tempt the foolhardy into
rushing forward. The riflemen had learned their
lesson, however, and maintained their alignment.
The advance was through nettles and briers, up
steep muddy banks and over fallen timber.</p>
<p>The warriors rushed repeatedly to the very muzzles
of our guns, and thus displayed a brand of
courage never surpassed, if ever equaled, by the
North American Indian before. It was Cornstalk
who was holding them to the bloody work. His
voice at times sounded very close, but although we
all knew his death would count a greater coup than
the scalps of a hundred braves we never could get
him. He was too shrewd and evasive.</p>
<p>Once I believed I had him, for I had located him
behind a detached mound of fallen timber. He was
loudly calling out for his men to be brave and
to lie close, when a warrior leaped up and started to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
run to the rear. Then Cornstalk flashed into view
long enough to sink his ax into the coward&#8217;s head.
It was all done so quickly that he dropped to cover
unharmed.</p>
<p>That was one of his ways of enforcing obedience,
a mode of terrorization never before practised by a
war-chief to my knowledge. It was told afterward
by the Shawnees that he killed more than that weak-hearted
one during the long day. I saw nothing of
the other chiefs who attended the conference in
Cornstalk&#8217;s Town while I was a prisoner. And yet
they were there, chiefs of Mingos, Wyandots, Delawares
and Ottawas.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re fallin&#8217; back! They&#8217;re fallin&#8217; back!&#8221;
yelled a voice in advance of our first line.</p>
<p>And the scream of a panther told us it was Cousin.
He had worked across from the left column,
and we were soon beholding his bright jacket in a
tangle of logs and stumps.</p>
<p>The men advanced more rapidly, but did not
break their line; and it was evident the savages
were giving ground in earnest. Our men renewed
their cheering and their lusty shouts were answered
by the column on the river-bank, still in advance of
us.</p>
<p>As it seemed we were about to rush the enemy
into a panic we received our second heavy loss of
the day. Colonel Field was shot dead. He was
standing behind a big tree, reserving his fire for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
an Indian who had been shouting filthy abuse at
him. Poor colonel! It was but a ruse to hold his
attention while savages up the slope and behind
fallen timber drew a bead on him. Captain Evan
Shelby assumed command and ordered the men to
keep up the advance.</p>
<p>The Indians gave ground, but with no signs of
confusion. Observing our left column was in advance
of the right, Cornstalk was attempting to
straighten his line by pulling in his left. As we
pressed on we discovered the savages were scalping
their own dead to prevent their hair falling into
our hands. From the rear of the red men came the
sound of many tomahawks. Cousin, who for a
moment found himself at my side, exulted:</p>
<p>&#8220;Curse &#8217;em! Their squaws an&#8217; boys are cuttin&#8217;
saplin&#8217;s for to carry off their wounded! They&#8217;ll
need a heap o&#8217; stretchers afore this day is over!&#8221;</p>
<p>The sun was now noon-high and the heat was
beastly. The battle was at its climax. The left
column was near a little pond and about fifty yards
from the river, or a fourth of a mile beyond the
spot where Lewis was shot. We had evened up
this lead, and the battle-line extended from the
river and pond to Crooked Creek and half-way
down the creek, running from west to east and then
southwest.</p>
<p>Cornstalk&#8217;s plan was to coop us up in the Point
and drive us into the Kanawha and Ohio. There
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_341' name='page_341'></a>341</span>
were times when our whole line gave ground, but
only to surge ahead again. Thus we seesawed back
and forth along a mile and a quarter of battle-line,
with the firing equal in intensity from wing to wing.
Nor had the Indians lost any of their high spirits.
Their retreat was merely a maneuver. They kept
shouting:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll show you how to shoot!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you come along?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you whistle now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have two thousand to fight to-morrow!&#8221;</p>
<p>But the force that held them together and impelled
them to make the greatest fight the American
Indian ever put up, not even excepting the battle of
Bushy Run, was Cornstalk. Truly he was a great
man, measured even by the white man&#8217;s standards!</p>
<p>&#8220;Be strong! Be brave! Lie close! Shoot well!&#8221;
flowed almost uninterruptedly from his lips.</p>
<p>Davis, of Howard&#8217;s Creek, went by me, making
for the rear with a shattered right arm and a
ghastly hole through his cheek. He tried to grin
on recognizing me. Word was passed on from our
rear that runners had been sent to hurry up Colonel
Christian and his two hundred men. Among the
captains killed by this time were John Murray and
Samuel Wilson. It was a few minutes after the
noon hour that Cousin emerged from the smoke on
my right and howled:</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s old Puck-i-n-shin-wa!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_342' name='page_342'></a>342</span></p>
<p>He darted forward, clearing all obstacles with
the ease of a deer. I saw the Shawnee chief, father
of Tecumseh, snap his piece at the boy. Then I saw
him go down with Cousin&#8217;s lead through his painted
head. Two savages sprang up and Cousin killed
one with his remaining barrel. The other fired
pointblank, and by the way Cousin fell I knew his
object in wearing the scarlet jacket was attained.
He had wished to die this day in the midst of battle.</p>
<p>William White killed Cousin&#8217;s slayer. The boy
was in advance of the line and his coat made him
conspicuous. Doubtless the savages believed him
to be an important officer because of it.</p>
<p>Five of them rushed in to secure his scalp, and
each fell dead, and their bodies concealed the boy
from view. Up to one o&#8217;clock the fighting raged
with undiminished fury, with never any cessation
of their taunts and epithets and Cornstalk&#8217;s stentorian
encouragement.</p>
<p>Now it is never in Indian nature to prolong a
conflict once it is obvious they must suffer heavy
losses. They consider it the better wisdom to run
away and await an opportunity when the advantage
will be with them. Cornstalk had been confident
that his early morning attack would drive us into the
rivers, thus affording his forces on the opposite
banks much sport in picking us off.</p>
<p>But so fiercely contested had been the battle that
none of our dead had been scalped except Hughey
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_343' name='page_343'></a>343</span>
and two or three men who fell at the first fire.
By all that we had learned of Indian nature they
should now, after six hours of continuous fighting,
be eager to withdraw. They had fought the most
bitterly contested battle ever participated in by their
race.</p>
<p>Nor had they, as in Braddock&#8217;s defeat, been aided
by white men. There were, to be true, several
white men among them, such as Tavenor Ross, John
Ward and George Collet; but these counted no more
than ordinary warriors and Collet was killed before
the fighting was half over. According to all precedents
the battle should have ended in an Indian
rout by the time the sun crossed the meridian.
Instead the savages stiffened their resistance and
held their line.</p>
<p>Our men cheered from parched throats when
word was passed that Collet&#8217;s body had been found
and identified. Poor devil! Perhaps it opened the
long trace to him, where everything would be made
right. He was captured when a child and had responded
to the only environment he had ever known.</p>
<p>The case of such as Collet&mdash;yes, and of John
Ward and Ross&mdash;is entirely different from that of
Timothy Dorman, and others of his kind, who was
captured when a grown man and who turned renegade
to revenge himself for wrongs, real or fancied,
on his old neighbors.</p>
<p>It was not until after seven hours of fighting that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_344' name='page_344'></a>344</span>
we detected any falling off in the enemy&#8217;s resistance.
Even then the savages had the advantage of an
excellent position, and to press them was extremely
hazardous business. We continued to crowd them,
however, until they were lined up on a long ridge
which extended from the small marsh where Cousin
and I first saw Robertson and Sevier, for half a
mile to the east, where it was cut by the narrow bed
of Crooked Creek.</p>
<p>None of us needed to be told that so long as the
enemy held this ridge our camp at the Point was in
grave danger. From the riflemen along the Ohio
word came that the Indians were throwing their
dead into the river, while squaws and boys were
dragging back their wounded.</p>
<p>This had a heartening effect on us, for it indicated
a doubt was creeping into the minds of the
savages. Once they permitted the possibility of
defeat to possess them their effectiveness would
decrease. Company commanders called on their men
to take the ridge, but to keep their line intact.</p>
<p>With wild cheers the men responded and buckled
down to the grueling task. Every patch of fallen
timber proved to be an Indian fort, where the bravest
of the tribes fought until they were killed. It was
stubborn traveling, but our riflemen were not to
be denied.</p>
<p>From along the line would come cries of:</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember Tygart&#8217;s Valley!&#8221;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_345' name='page_345'></a>345</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Remember Carr&#8217;s Creek!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember the Clendennins!&#8221;</p>
<p>And always Cornstalk&#8217;s voice answered:</p>
<p>&#8220;Be strong! Be brave! Fight hard!&#8221;</p>
<p>So we struggled up the slope, gaining a yard at
a time and counting it a triumph if we passed a pile
of dead timber and gained another a few feet
beyond.</p>
<p>When we were most encouraged the Indians
began mocking us and shouting exultingly and
informing us that the warriors across the Kanawha
and Ohio had attacked our camp and were massacring
the small force retained there. This statement,
repeatedly hurled at us with every semblance
of savage gloating, tended to weaken the men&#8217;s one
purpose. We could capture the ridge&mdash;but! Behind
our determination crawled the fear that we
might be assailed in the rear at any moment.</p>
<p>Captain Shelby was quick to realize the depressing
influence of this kind of talk, and shouted for
the word to be passed that it was an Indian trick,
that our troops were guarding the Kanawha for
half a mile up the stream and that the warriors on
the Indian shore could not cross over without the
column on our left discovering the move.</p>
<p>This prompted our common sense to return to us,
and we remembered that Andrew Lewis was too
cool and shrewd to be caught napping. The Point
was sprinkled with huge trees and it would take a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_346' name='page_346'></a>346</span>
big force to clear it of our reserves; and the bulk of
the enemy was before us on the ridge.</p>
<p>With renewed vigor we made greater exertions
and at last reached the top of the ridge and cleared
it. But even then the Indians were not defeated.
They charged up with ferocious energy time after
time, and the best we could do was to cling to our
position and let them bring the fighting to us. So
different was their behavior from any we had been
familiar with in previous engagements we began to
wonder if they would violate other Indian precedents
and continue the battle into the night.</p>
<p>It was not until three or four o&#8217;clock that we
noticed any lessening in their efforts to retake the
ridge. At the best this afforded us only a short
breathing-spell. There were many warriors still
hidden along the slopes drained by Crooked Creek.
Our line was so long there was always danger of
the Indians concentrating and breaking it.</p>
<p>So long as we stuck to the ridge on the defensive
the enemy had the advantage of the initiative. A
runner brought up word from Colonel Lewis to
learn the strength of the savages in the hills along
the creek, and I was directed to reconnoiter.</p>
<p>I made for the creek from the south slope of the
ridge. Sliding down the muddy bank, I ascended
the opposite slope and began making my way toward
the point where the creek cut through the ridge. I
encountered no Indians, although axes and knives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_347' name='page_347'></a>347</span>
on the ground showed where they had been stationed
before retiring.</p>
<p>I passed through the cut and was suddenly confronted
by what I thought at first must be the devil.
The fellow was wearing the head of a buffalo, horns
and tangled forelock and all. Through the eye-slits
gleamed living eyes. The shock of his grotesque
appearance threw me off my guard for a moment.
He leaped upon me and we went down the bank into
the bed of the creek.</p>
<p>He had his ax ready to use but I caught his hand.
His hideous mask proved to be his undoing, for as
we rolled about it became twisted. I was quick to
see my advantage. Relying on one hand to hold
his wrist, I used all my quickness and strength and
succeeded in turning the mask half-way around,
leaving him blind and half-smothered. I killed him
with his own ax before he could remove his cumbersome
headgear.</p>
<p>As none of his companions had come to his
rescue I knew this marked their most advanced position
in the hills. Having learned all I could without
sacrificing my life, I began my retreat down the
creek and narrowly escaped being shot by one of
our own men.</p>
<p>Captain Shelby ordered me to report to Colonel
Lewis, which I did, running at top speed without
attempting to keep under cover. I found the reserves
had thrown up a breastwork from the Ohio
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_348' name='page_348'></a>348</span>
to the Kanawha, thus inclosing the camp on the
Point. It lacked half an hour of sunset when I
reached the camp.</p>
<p>Colonel Lewis heard me, then ordered Captains
Isaac Shelby, Arbuckle, Matthews and Stuart to
lead their companies up Crooked Creek under cover
of the bank until they could secure a position behind
the Indians and enfilade their main line. I scouted
ahead of this force. We circled the end of the Indian
line, but were at once discovered.</p>
<p>Instead of this being our undoing, it proved to be
all in our favor. Cornstalk&#8217;s spies had kept him
informed of Colonel Christian&#8217;s presence a few
miles from the Point. He took it for granted that
this force in the hills behind his line was reinforcements
brought up by Christian, and this belief
caused him to order a general retirement across Old
Town Creek. At that time Christian was fifteen
miles from the Point. Sunset found us in full
possession of the battle-field.</p>
<p>Leaving strong outposts, we retired to the well-protected
camp, rejoicing loudly and boasting of
more than two-score scalps. We carried off all our
dead and wounded. The exact Indian loss was
never definitely settled but it must have equaled, if
not exceeded, ours. More than a score were found
in the woods covered deep with brush, and many
were thrown into the river.</p>
<p>This battle ended Dunmore&#8217;s War, also known as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_349' name='page_349'></a>349</span>
Cresap&#8217;s War and the Shawnee War. So far as actual
fighting and losses are considered it was a
drawn battle. But as Cornstalk could not induce
his men to renew the conflict, and inasmuch as they
retreated before morning to the Indian shore, the
victory must be held to be with the backwoodsmen.</p>
<p>And yet the tribes were not entirely downcast, for
during the early evening they continued to taunt us
and to repeat their threats of bringing an army of
two thousand on to the field in the morning. In
fact, many of our men believed the savages had a
shade the better of the fight, and would renew hostilities
in the morning.</p>
<p>That night we buried Shelby Cousin on the bank
of the Kanawha and built a fire over his grave to
conceal it. Colonel Christian arrived at midnight,
and there was some lurid profanity when his men
learned they had arrived too late for the fighting.
One week after the battle eleven hundred troops
crossed the Ohio to carry the war to the Indian
towns for a final decision.</p>
<p>When thirteen miles south of Chillicothe, the
town Governor Dunmore had ordered us to attack
and destroy, a message arrived from His Lordship,
directing Colonel Lewis to halt his advance, for
peace was about to be made. Hostile bands had fired
upon us that very morning, and the position was not
suitable for a camp. Colonel Lewis continued the
march for a few miles. Another messenger arrived
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_350' name='page_350'></a>350</span>
with orders for us to halt, for the peace was about
to be consummated.</p>
<p>We went into camp on Congo Creek, about five
miles from Chillicothe. The men raged something
marvelous. They insisted that no decisive battle had
been fought and that we had thrown away nearly a
hundred lives if the fighting were not renewed.
The Shawnees were in our power. What folly to
let them escape!</p>
<p>Dunmore and White Eyes, the friendly Delaware
chief, rode into camp and conferred with Colonel
Lewis; and as a result we started the next day for
Point Pleasant and Virginia. The men were all
but out of bounds, so furious were they at not being
loosed at the Shawnees.</p>
<p>Then began the talk that Dunmore brought on the
war to keep our backwoodsmen busy in event the
colonies rebelled against England; also, that he
closed it prematurely so that the Indians might continue
a menace to the border and thus keep the
frontier men at home.</p>
<p>I was as hot as any against His Lordship for the
way the campaign ended. We demanded blood for
blood in those days; and never had the Virginia
riflemen a better chance for inflicting lasting punishment
on their ancient foes. And we were quick
to blame His Lordship for a variety of unwholesome
motives.</p>
<p>But with political rancor long since buried we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_351' name='page_351'></a>351</span>
can survey that campaign more calmly and realize
that as a result of the battle the northwest Indians
kept quiet for the first two years of the Revolutionary
War, and that during this period Kentucky was
settled and the vast continent west of the Alleghanies
was saved to the Union.</p>
<p>If the battle of Bushy Run took the heart out of
the tribes confederated under Pontiac&#8217;s masterly
leadership, then Dunmore&#8217;s War permitted us to
begin life as a republic without having the Alleghanies
for our western boundary. Nor can I hold
in these latter days that His Lordship was insincere
in waging the war; for England was against it from
the first.</p>
<p>I believed he pushed the war as vigorously and
shrewdly as he knew how; and I believe his was the
better judgment in securing the best peace-terms
possible instead of heaping defeat on defeat until
the allied tribes had nothing left to bargain for.
So I give His Lordship credit for making a good
bargain with the Indians, and a bargain which aided
the colonists during the struggle almost upon them.
But I was very happy when Colonel Andrew Lewis
drove him from Virginia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>PEACE COMES TO THE CLEARING</h3>
</div>

<p>Early winter, and the wind was crisp and cold
as I rode into Howard&#8217;s Creek. Smoke rose
from the cabins. I limped toward the Davis cabin,
a strange shyness holding me back. Some one
inside was singing:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;Ye daughters and sons of Virginia, incline</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.73em;'>Your ears to a story of woe;</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>I sing of a time when your fathers and mine</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.73em;'>Fought for us on the Ohio.</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>In seventeen hundred and seventy-four,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.73em;'>The month of October, we know,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>An army of Indians, two thousand or more,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.73em;'>Encamped on the Ohio.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>There was a whirl of linsey petticoats behind me,
and two plump arms were about my neck; and her
dear voice was sobbing:</p>
<p>&#8220;They didn&#8217;t know! I feared you were dead
beyond the Ohio!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But I sent you a message!&#8221; I protested, patting
her bowed head. &#8220;I sent word by Moulton that it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_353' name='page_353'></a>353</span>
was only an arrow-wound in the leg, and that I
must wait.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;And he never came, nor brought your word!
He stopped in Tygart&#8217;s Valley and sent his brother
to bring Mrs. Moulton and the children. One man
said he heard you had been hurt. I wrote to Colonel
Lewis but he was not at Richfield. So I never
knew!&#8221;</p>
<p>We walked aside, and I petted her and listened to
her dear voice and forgot the cold wind biting into
my thin blood, forgot I would always walk with a
slight limp. When we did awake, because the early
dusk was filling the clearing, the singer was finishing
his seventeen-stanza song:</p>
<table summary='poetry' style='margin:0 auto'><tr><td>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>&#8220;As Israel did mourn and her daughters did weep,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.73em;'>For Saul and his host on Gilbow,</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.0em;'>We&#8217;ll mourn Colonel Field and the heroes who sleep</p>
<p  style='margin: 0 0 0 0.73em;'>On the banks of the Ohio.&#8221;</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>And I thought of Shelby Cousin and the others,
who gave their lives that we might meet thus without
the war-whoop interrupting our wooing. And
I wondered if our children&#8217;s children would ever
realize that the deaths died at Point Pleasant made
life and happiness possible for them. I prayed it
might be so, for lonely graves are not so lonely if
they are not forgotten.</p>
